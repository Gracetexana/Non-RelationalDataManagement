I want to thank my wife, Sue, for letting me go again and holding down the fort while I am gone. She will be coming to visit for two and a half weeks shortly. I look forward to her visit. My son Ed is also planning to come soon. He works for Google and will be in Munich on business so he is coming for a week. It will be good to have him here \u2013 two Eds are better than one, i always say. 8-)\n\nThe flight was great, much better than last year except I had an expected 6 hour layover in Munich. On the plus side I had an aisle seat with no one beside me so it was easy to stretch out and move around. I took the flight with the layover so I could arrive to get some preparation done today for next week. Other flights got me here later. Next week I am offering a \u201cboot camp\u201d for new students. This will help acquaint them with computing and give them the basics of programming. Hopefully it will be fun.\n\nTJ, My friend and colleague from last year, is going to be in Zagreb this fall, so I may not see him here. He is offering the same \u201cboot camp\u201d in Zagreb.\n\nDubrovnik is still the bustling place I remember from last year. At the beginning of my stay there are thousands of tourists. I knew that the one millionth person this year was to arrive at the Dubrovnik airport yesterday also. I also knew he or she was on a different airline, so I couldn\u2019t be me. The article is at the following link:\n\n<a title=\"Atcile in the Dubrovnik Times\" href=\"http://www.dubrovacki.hr/clanak/41993/i-am-completely-surprised-at-first-i-thought-it-was-a-joke-millionth-passenger\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dubrovacki.hr/clanak/41993/i-am-completely-surprised-at-first-i-thought-it-was-a-joke-millionth-passenger<\/a>\n\nI got thinking as I was wandering around today amidst all the tourists, Dubrovnik is a city of about 25,000 people. During the high season about 10 to 16,000 tourists arrive on cruise ships each day, usually staying one day. If a million also have arrived since about May on planes, that is a lot of people. The population must double during the high season. It is much nicer here during the middle of my stay. At the end it is very dead and many establishments are closed.\n\nMy apartment this year is right in the thick of the activity near the pile (pee-lay) gate of the Old City, but my apartment is remarkably quiet. I miss my old apartment, with the view of the harbor and the thirty minute walk along the Adriatic Sea to work each day. My current apartment does not have the view or the walk. On the plus side I have a three minute walk to work and other nice places to walk. I also have ZERO steps going up to my apartment. I counted them. If you remember, I had 198 steps up to my apartment last year. I am also close to several old churches.\n\nI went shopping today to pick up some things I needed in addition to food.The stores close to me here are too crowded and don\u2019t have a good selection. I picked up some essentials last night, but today I decided to walk down to the large Konzum near where I lived last year. I needed a measuring cup, a coffee maker and Vanilla Crunchy Pillows. Those of you who followed last year, you may remember my love affair with Vanilla Crunchy Pillows breakfast cereal. The store near me only had chocolate.\n\nI got everything I needed except the coffee maker. The apartment does not have a coffee maker. I thought I would get a French press but the Konzum did not have one. I am going on a dire search tomorrow. I do need coffee in the morning. Fortunately for now, my favorite coffee shop is also three minutes away - Sesame (sez-em).\n\nIt has been very hot here. Today it was 90 degrees Fahrenheit and hazy and humid. I prefer to think of it as 32 (degrees Celsius) \u2013 it seems cooler. After my walk to the Konzum, I decided to stay in for a while and do some school work. It has been so hot here that they have had several wild fires in the hills and agriculture has been suffering. Sound familiar?\n\nLast year, I regretted that my camera did not take good low light pictures. So I decided to upgrade to a new camera and I am very pleased with it. The following is a picture I took a little while ago from the Pile gate:\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_637\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscn0038.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-637\" title=\"Picture from Pile Gate in Dubrovnik\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscn0038.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Picture of Old City wall from Pile Gate in Dubrovnik[/caption]\n\nWell that is all for now. Jet lag is catching up. I think it is time for bed.\nHope all is well, Ed","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":636,"wp:post_date":"2012-08-24 21:37:19","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-08-24 21:37:19","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"friday-9242012","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-08-24 21:37:19"}}

I went to bed late last night and didn\u2019t wake up until almost noon. That is very unusual for me. So I got up, got ready, which included a breakfast of Crunchy Pillows and went on a search for a coffee press. No success.\n\nAs I was leaving my apartment, I stopped to talk to Ana, a young girl who stands outside the Mimosa Restaurant drumming up business. Many restaurants here do that. They have a menu and ask if you would like to come in and eat. Mimosa is one of my favorite restaurants here.  I have known Ana since last year. She is very friendly and we tease each other.  Today\u2019s special \u2013 either tuna or swordfish for 82 Kuna (about $14). I commented that it was only 80 Kuna on Thursday night. She said I had better eat now because it might be 84 Kuna tomorrow. I will save Minosa for when Sue or Eddie are here. I hope they will still have the fresh Adriatic tuna.\n\nI decided to walk to a couple of little malls down near where I used to live and see if there was a coffee press anywhere. They were mostly clothing stores. I tried the Tommy grocery store in one mall but nothing there either. It is pretty hot here so by that time I needed some water, so I bought a large bottle of sparkling water and went to the Promenade to sit a rest a while and drink some water. The Promenade is this long walk down near where I used to live with all kinds of restaurants and entertainment. It ends at the sea with a large beach, which was packed today (88 F).\n\nI walked back along the promenade and along the harbor on my way to another little mall and another Tommy. It was a nice walk. Everything seems as it was when I left, except where the promenade hits the main street there is now a roundabout. Two streets used to come to a \u201cT\u201d. The other mall also was mostly clothing stores. The other Tommy had an electric coffee maker, but that is not what I was looking for. So I bought a couple things I needed including a six liter bottle of water (heavy). Fortunately I had my backpack. All-in-all it was a nice walk, but no coffee press. I will have to ask someone on Monday. I know there must be stores that sell that type of thing. Most stores that are not tourist related close early on Saturday and are closed on Sunday, so I may not have found the store open anyway.\n\nWhen I came back to my apartment near the Old City, I decided to do some laundry. And take a short nap. I have a washer and a dryer in this apartment. The dryer is an interesting device. It has no exhaust. I am not sure where the lint goes. There is a little tray on top that fills with water and when it gets full the dryer shuts off until you empty it. I had to empty it three times. It seems to work well, however.\n\nAfter my nap I cooked dinner, chivaps with pasta, peppers, onions, broccoli and tomatoes. Chivaps are small ground meat rolls. As I was eating, I was listening to NPR on my iPad. I called Sue on Skype and we had our usual daily conversation. She is up in the Adirondacks and is expecting a lot of company.  After I cleaned up, I decided to go over to the Old City to find out the Mass times at the Franciscan church. I like that church. They have some beautiful singers. Sue remembered 10:30 and I remembered 11:00. As usual here, there is no sign so I guess I will go at 10:30 and see what happens.\n\nThis is the music festival in Dubrovnik. Each night there is a concert in from of the Church of St Blaise (Sv. Vlaho). Tonight\u2019s concert is opera with an opera company from Ljubljana, Slovenia and the Slovenian Symphony Orchestra (Somebody tell Dusan. Ljubljana is his home town). It was phenomenal, and I don\u2019t usually care for opera. I could only stay for a few minutes because I was tired and wanted to get home (that jet lag thing again). What I heard was very good. There is nothing like an outdoor concert.\n\nI will leave you with a few more pictures. The first is of the concert and the rest are of the wall near the Pile gate at night. Enjoy.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_643\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscn0042.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-643\" title=\"Concert at Church of St. Blaise\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscn0042.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Concert at Church of St. Blaise[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_644\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscn0040.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-644\" title=\"DSCN0040\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscn0040.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> City wall of Dubrovnik near Pile Gate.

I got up this morning at about 8:45, which is good because I had set my alarm for 9:00. Maybe the jet lag is getting better. I enjoyed my bowl of Crunchy Pillows then got ready for church.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if Mass was at 10:30 or 11 so I arrived at the Franciscan church in the Old City about 10:20. I had forgotten I live only five minutes away. The 9:30 Mass was just finishing which was sung by a great men\u2019s choir (although I couldn\u2019t find the choir).  I used the time to meditate. I have just started reading The Imitation of Christ again, so I had a lot to meditate on.\n\nThe Mass at 11:00 Mass was beautiful and crowded. There are three girls who sing and do a beautiful job. The closing song is one that we sing at St. Charles a lot, <em>Lord, You Have Come<\/em> (<em>Pescador de Hombres<\/em>)? They sing the Croatian version. Here is the English:\n\n<em>Lord, You Have Come<\/em> (<em>Pescador de Hombres<\/em>)?\n\n1. Lord, you have come to the seashore,\nneither searching for the rich nor the wise,\ndesiring only that I should follow.\n\nRefrain\nO, Lord, with your eyes set upon me,\ngently smiling, you have spoken my name;\nall I longed for I have found by the water,\nat your side, I will seek other shores.\n\n2. Lord, see my goods, my possessions;\nin my boat you find no power, no wealth.\nWill you accept, then, my nets and labor?\n\n3. Lord, take my hands and direct them.\nHelp me spend myself in seeking the lost,\nreturning love for the love you gave me.\n\n4. Lord, as I drift on the waters,\nbe the resting place of my restless heart,\nmy life's companion, my friend and refuge.\n\nIt is a beautiful song and these girls did a very nice job. It was very meditative.\n\nAfter Mass I walked to Sesame to get a cup of Coffee (stillno coffee maker). So I relaxed a bit under the shade of an umbrella and watched people for a while. A faculty member form ACMT walked by and said hello. I think that is the first ACMT person I have run into.\n\nI returned to the apartment and looked at the news to see what is going on in the world. Sorry I looked 8-(.  My daily news habit is to look at BBC, YNN, DemocratandChronicle and Syracuse.com. The last two mostly for obituaries. At almost 62 I am beginning to know more people there.\n\nI then worked for the rest of the afternoon except for a couple Skype calls. I thought this would be a good time to work since it is so hot outside. At about 8:30 I decided to take a walk through the Old City, which was still crowded with tourists. I then stopped at the Sandvich shop and got a Chivapcici sandwich. This must be new on their menu. I don\u2019t remember it from last year. It was good.\n\nNow I think I will head to bed. Tomorrow I have to move into my office and prepare for the bootcamp for freshmen beginning on Tuesday. I also have to go register with the policija at 10:00.\n\nAgain, I will leave you with some pictures from my walk tonight. (Note: clicking on the picture will make it full size)\n\nHope all is well.

I am doing a boot camp for new students tomorrow and I don\u2019t really know what to expect. It will run from 9:00 until 15:00 with a break for lunch. I also have to have a break every hour because so many students smoke over here. It is a shame to see, actually. I harass them periodically, but it does little good.\n\nI woke up to pounding and construction work going on in front of my apartment. My landlord has had a nice grape arbor constructed in front of the building. Tonight he has parked his car under it. I am not sure how that will work when the grapes get ripe and fall on the car. I will let you know.\n\nMy day started out by moving into my office. It went well, and I got to see a lot of people from last year and it was good to see them. Over the summer one of the faculty members turned my office into a research lab and there is some refrigerator like machine growing protozoa. So they told me that if I start turning green that is a good thing because I am absorbing more carbon dioxide which is good for the environment. Actually, he will be moving it out on Wednesday. I will have two roommates this quarter; one from Rochester (an IT person like me) and another from Zagreb (Philosophy). They should be here at the end of the week for the official start of classes next week.\n\nAt 10:00 we went to the police to register me as a guest worker. A very simple process as long as it is for 90 days or less. One of our staff has a great relationship with the people there and they don\u2019t even bother to look at my passport. Of course they have a copy and my landlord has already registered me as a resident. We were in and out in 10 minutes. The cab ride took longer. The trick, she says, is to always be honest. Doesn\u2019t that make sense.\n\nI then worked with our system administrator to get the lab ready for the boot camp and did some preparation work.\n\nAfter work at about 5:30, I called Sue in the states. She was in Utica at her sister\u2019s and was about to start for Rochester. She had Anna, my granddaughter from Boston, with her and I talked to Anna and her PahBoo (short for Pooh Bear). PahBoo did not say much, but Anna did. Anna is going back to spend the week with Sue.  That will be fun. It will also help Andrea while Ed is on his trip to Munich and his visit to me here.\n\nI then went on a mission.\n\n1. Find a coffee maker.\n\n2. Get my phone (borrowed from ACMT) charged up with minutes.\n\n3. Get a 6L jug of water (heavy). I have some but wanted to stock up. If I want a large bottle, I have to go to the big grocery stores. I can get 6L for about 12 kuna. If I buy it near where I live I get a 1.5L bottle for 9 kuna. So it pays to take a walk to the big stores.\n\nSuccess on all counts. The receptionist at ACMT told me of a store that would likely have a coffee maker. It is called Robot and it is near a large Pemo grocery store near where I was on Saturday, next door to the Tommy by the harbor. So close. It seems like no one here has heard of a French press. So I bought a drip coffee maker. It was 199 kuna, about $33; about 33 cents per day. I will \u201cwill\u201d it to someone when I leave. It is no good in the USA because it uses different electricity. So I have cleaned it up and it is ready to go for morning. Life is good. I also bought a couple of wine glasses. The apartment only had one. Generally, however, the apartment is well furnished.\n\nAlso, some interesting news. The HBO series \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d will be filming here again this year, while Sue is here. It was interesting to watch last year although I have never seen the show. I don\u2019t have cable.\n\nHere is a link if you want to read about it: <a href=\"http://www.dubrovacki.hr/clanak/42120/game-of-thrones-back-in-september\">http://www.dubrovacki.hr/clanak/42120/game-of-thrones-back-in-september<\/a>\n\nWell that is all for now. I am going to finish some prep work and go to bed. All-in-all it was a good day.\n\nHope all is well. Ed\n\n&nbsp;","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":665,"wp:post_date":"2012-08-27 20:45:51","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-08-27 20:45:51","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"monday-8272012-the-great-coffee-search-and-other-activities","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-08-27 20:45:51"}}

It was so good. The new coffee maker works fine. I had breakfast and got ready for work, including wearing a tie. They expect that faculty will get more dressed up here than in the States. The president and dean walked by my office and commented that he appreciated the tie. He was wearing one too.\n\nI had a busy day today. Today was the first day of the IT Freshman Boot Camp. It ran from 9:00 until 15:00 with a break for lunch.  The goal of this three day event is to get the students comfortable with computing. I have 10 new students and of the 10 only one has done any programming. If I contrast that with the US, about 8 would have had some experience in high school. This has its good points and bad points. On the negative side, the inexperienced fear making a mistake so they are somewhat timid and awkward at trying new things.  American students with some experience will usually try anything. On the negative side for American students, they already think they know everything. That presents a different challenge.  Today we discussed basic programming concepts and developed some simple programs using a system called Scratch, developed at MIT. Scratch allows users to \u201cwrite\u201d programs by just moving things around on the screen so they can concentrate on the basic concepts. Tomorrow we will get more into \u201creal\u201d programming using some graphical tools and a language called Java.\n\nIt was a nice day here today. The temperature was in the low 80s and is currently about 70F.Everyone is relieved that it has cooled off a bit. On the down side, there is smoke in the air and everyone\u2019s allergies are flaring up. I was talking to Larissa this morning and she said that she had ash on her car the other day. There were two large fires in Bosnia I Herzegovina  (BIH) that have merged into one. It is on the other side of Mt. Srd. It should not be a danger here but there is the smell of burning pine in the air. It has been an extremely dry year here and fires have been common throughout the Balkins. Here is a related article about Serbia and Croatia. This is NOT near me, so don\u2019t worry.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19395545\">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19395545<\/a>\n\nAfter supper, I decided to walk down to Lapad to do some grocery shopping. I needed some meat, vegetables and fruit.  It was a nice night for a walk. All the big grocery stores are in Lapad.\n\nWhen I got back to my apartment I did a little planning for tomorrow and now it is off to bed.\n\nHope all is well.

I got up this morning and got ready for day 2 of the boot camp for new students. I always check the weather channel on the Internet to see what the forecast is for the day. It is usually the same \u2013 sun and hot. Today I saw a first. The forecast was hot and \u201csmoky\u201d. I never saw that before. This must be what they see all the time out in the western US. Anyway, I took a picture this morning out the 4<sup>th<\/sup> floor window of ACMT so you can see the haze in the distance.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_672\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscn0054.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-672\" title=\"DSCN0054\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscn0054.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> The Old City showing haze from brush fire smoke[/caption]\n\nRemember that the 4<sup>th<\/sup> floor is actually the 5<sup>th<\/sup> floor by US standards. The bottom floor is always called the ground floor. The first floor (our second floor) is above the ground floor. I think it is that way all over Europe.\n\nThe boot camp went well today. The students seem energized by the material we are covering. The real test will be when the programming course really starts next week. Will they be able to perform better than earlier classes? It will be an interesting experiment.\n\nAfter class tonight, I spent some time rearranging my office so that I don\u2019t have wires running everywhere. I thought I would get it organized before my two office mates arrive later this week. When I finished that I went home to cook dinner and went to one of the local stores to get some milk for cereal in the morning. I also took my garbage to the garbage station.\n\nOne problem with the stores near me is that they are aimed at tourists, so I can only get smaller, more expensive, sizes of things. I think I have already mentioned this with the water but it is also true for milk. I could only get a 1L size bottle of milk. I prefer the larger one.\n\nWhile I was out, I took this picture of the almost full orange moon over the tower of the Franciscan church from outside the wall near the Pile gate. The moon seems hazy also.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_673\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscn0055.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-673\" title=\"DSCN0055\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/dscn0055.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Almost full moon over the Franciscan tower[/caption]\n\nI wanted to go to daily Mass tonight and thought there was Mass at 19:30 and I heard a bell so I hurried off to the Franciscan church. Oops \u2013 Mass was at 19:00. I may try again tomorrow. I would like to get into a daily Mass routine if I can.\n\nI came back to the apartment and answered email, organized my calendar and will get ready for bed. A good day, but nothing exciting happened 8-).\n\nHope all is well.

I got up this morning and got ready for work. As I was leaving at about 8:45, my landlord, Niko, knocked at the door to tell me that a painter would be painting my door today. The painter turned out to be his brother so I talked to him for a minute. He had lived in the US for a little while in California with Niko and his wife, but he could not get a green card so he had to leave. He now works on a catamaran that goes among the islands. He works 15 days and has 15 off. He paints during his off days. This assumes I got the conversation right.\n\nNiko also invited me to a gathering on Sunday night at 8:00. It is a gathering of English-speaking people in Dubrovnik and somehow a TV crew is involved. It should be fun and I am looking forward to it. I will let you know how it goes. It was nice of him to invite me.\n\nI got to school just in time for class. Today I finished the last day of the IT boot camp for new students. I think this went very well. Most of the students seemed to be energized by the experience. I actually had them programming by the second say. I think this will give them a leg up when they start the regular classes next week.  Some of the students have been loading the software on their own computers so they can continue doing things. This was satisfying to me also.\n\nAfter class, I did a couple of cleanup activities in the office then went home. I cooked dinner and cleaned up before going for a walk on some of the waking-only streets behind my apartment. It was an interesting walk. I found that there is a whole maze of walking-only streets behind my place. The door to my landlord\u2019s apartment above me is actually on this street behind me that I can\u2019t even see from my apartment. I am not too familiar with these streets because I have not been in this area before. It was fun to wander around.\n\nAt 19:00, I went to Mass at the Franciscan church. It was very short and there were probably 40 - 50 people there. There were a lot of nuns. It was nice to be at daily Mass, even in Croatian. They say the rosary and a litany before Mass. I probably should learn some prayers in Croatian.\n\nAfter Mass, I wanted a gelato from Sue\u2019s favorite gelato store, but I decided to wait for her. I spent some time wandering around the Old City. I walked around the old harbor and it was beautiful with an almost full, orange moon. The lights came on and it was even more beautiful. I will leave you with some of the pictures I took tonight. I love this camera. Remember to click on the picture to enlarge it.\n\nHope all is well.

I wanted something that would work in low light. I bought a Nikon Coolpix S8200. It is a discontinued model and Rowe had it $80 off, so it put it in the price range of some lesser cameras. I also like the fact that the controls that you use most often are clearly visible and logically placed. I have enjoyed using it, so far. \nI am in your old apartment. I am enjoying it so far but I do miss the view in Lapad. I am finding other places to walk,however. I am not sure if Luci is coming while I am here, but I will look for the figs. One of my students brought me some last year and they are good. \nI have been to both of the Konzums near me. Mike told me about another that is about half way to Gruz, which I will have to find. I have found that it makes a less stressful shopping experience if I walk down to Gruz for any major shopping, and I think the prices are cheaper also.

{"title":"Friday - 8/31/2012 - JMJ(D)","link":"http://travelsofed.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/friday-8312012-jmjd/","pubDate":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 21:13:45 +0000","dc:creator":"epholden","guid":{"isPermaLink":false,"content":"http://travelsofed.wordpress.com/?p=712"},"description":"","content:encoded":"<p style=\"text-align:center;\">JMJ(D)<\/p>\nToday was a busy day. I had a number of things that had to get done before classes officially start on Monday. I decided to work from my apartment and it worked out well. I did have to run over to the office for a little while to upload some large files to our course system. The Internet connection is a little slow for that type of work, though it works well for most other things.\n\nAfter finishing the work I had to finish today I made some dinner. I stir fried some chicken with onions in olive oil with some spice that translates from Croatian to Mediterranean spices. I am not sure what it is, but it is a nice combination. I will have to investigate that. I also made a nice salad with lettuce, tomato, gouda cheese and croutons, drizzled with my favorite balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It was a nice dinner.\n\nAfter cleanup, I went to Mass at the Franciscan church. Every once in a while I recognize a song melody they sing. Last night they ended Mass with \u201cCome Holy Ghost\u201d. Tonight they started Mass with \u201cMichael Row the Boat Ashore\u201d. I chimed in on the Alleluias. All These very serious Franciscan nuns look at me funny. I am going to work harder to learn the Mass responses in Croatian. There is a web site that has sided-by-side translations of the Mass called \u201cThe Travelers Mass\u201d. Here it is if you are interested:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.angilella.it/missa/\">http://www.angilella.it/missa/<\/a>\n\nI will be using the en2/hr version. Hr is the official abbreviation for Croatia (Hrvatska).\n\nAfter Mass I walked around the old city for a while. Every restaurant was cooking fish. It smelled so good. I am glad I ate before I came. It was a beautiful evening in the old city. I enjoyed my walk. As I was coming back I noticed that the Dominican church was open. I had never been in there before so I decided to go in and take a look. Last year when I was here it was closed for renovation so I never got inside. Wow, is that a beautiful church! It has a beautiful wood ceiling. I will try to take some pictures some time when the church is open and quiet. I went in and knelt down to say a prayer. There were a few other people in there. After a couple of minutes, a Dominican nun got up and went to close the door. Everyone seemed to take that as closing time. As I walked out I smiled at her and she gave me quite the frown. Not sure what I did wrong. I think the nuns here are sick of tourists who come into the churches more interested in seeing the sights that worshipping the reason for the church. It can be disruptive when services are going on.\n\nI have always liked Dominican and Franciscan nuns. When I was in grade school at St. Mary\u2019s School in Fulton, NY, I had Dominican nuns for nine years (K \u2013 8). They were an important part of my upbringing. They always had us put JMJD (Jesus, Mary, Joseph and Dominic) at the top of our papers. When I went to Oswego Catholic High School in Oswego, NY, I continued to write JMJD, but not for long. I was corrected to JMJ since the nuns were Franciscan. I don\u2019t know why it wasn\u2019t JMJF. The Franciscan nuns also played an important part in my life. Now I don\u2019t write anything at the top of my paper. Maybe I should. That would surprise my students.\n\nBoth of those schools are closed. It is sad to think that few Catholic children today will experience the benefits of a catholic education with the nuns. They certainly kept you going straight.\n\nSt. Dominic was known as a great preacher. He founded an order of priests called the Order of Preachers (OP) in 1216, followed by nuns in 1218. St Francis founded the Franciscans in 1210. He then founded the Order of Poor Clares with St. Clare. Both orders have a long history.\n\nWhen we got letters from Br. Charles Varnak after he left St. Charles parish and Cardinal Mooney HS in Rochester, he would always write JMJ at the top. It always made you stop and think. He was a Brother of the Holy Cross. The Congregation of Holy Cross or Congregatio a Sancta Cruce (C.S.C.) is a Catholic congregation of priests and brothers founded in 1837 by Blessed Father Basil Anthony-Marie Moreau, CSC, in Le Mans, France. He was beatified in 2007. Sorry for the ramble - one thought led to another.\n\nWhen I got back to my apartment, I had a Skype call with a colleague in Rochester about a course we teach in common. It was good to talk to him.\n\nNow off to bed. Tomorrow there is an orientation session at the Imperial Hilton at 10:00, so I will be there. I live next door to the hotel, so I have no excuses.\n\nI also have to start thinking about a new picture for the header of this blog. The current one is from my old apartment. I will start looking at my pictures.\n\nHope all is well.

Yep, it is number 62. All is well here in Dubrovnik. As I was eating breakfast (yes, Crunchy Pillows) I looked at the news and read my email. My first email message was from my buddy John in Oswego wishing me a happy birthday. He turned 62 eight days ago so he is much older than I am. I won't even talk about Sue. I also had an email from Emily. Early in the afternoon here, Laura called me on Skype. So I have had plenty of attention on this highest of days.\n\nI also had a couple of cards from Sue and Emily, Zac, Maggie and baby girl that Sue tucked into my luggage before I left along with some chocolate chip cookies. I think I will save the latter for Monday and bring them to ACMT. I have kept them in the refrigerator so I think they should still be good.\n\nI also had a nice Skype call from Sue and company at camp in the Adirondacks. They all sang happy birthday, including Anna and Maggie. Anna wanted to know if I could \u201ccome over in a minute.\u201d I said it would have to wait. Croatia is a long way away.\n\nI also had emails from my good friends Emmett and Janet, and Joyce. It was nice of everyone to remember me on my birthday. I hope I didn\u2019t leave anyone out.\n\nI had to get up this morning to go to the beginning of Freshman Orientation at the Imperial Hilton. The opening session was short, less than an hour. It was nice to see all the eager faces. There were short welcoming addresses by the administration and we, the faculty, introduced ourselves.  All my freshman walked in and waved to me. I had them last week in boot camp. I think it will be a good quarter.\n\nAfter the opening addresses, the students headed over to ACMT and Larisa, Doug (a colleague from RIT) and I went to have coffee. We had a nice visit. After an hour or so, Larisa\u2019s husband came to pick her up and Doug and I continued for another hour. Time can fly over a cup of coffee here in Croatia. Doug bought since it was my birthday.\n\nFor lunch I stopped at a bakery on the way home and bought some burek s mesom ( a pastry with meat) If you want to see what it looked like there is a picture here. It looks like the first picture on the right.\n\n<a href=\"http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burek\">http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burek<\/a>\n\nThey also have burek sa sirom (the same pastry with cheese). The pastry is like philo dough.\n\nI did some preparation for next week. I then went to the Tommy near Gruz (new harbor) where I used to live. I needed quite a few groceries. They were heavy but it was good exercise. I then came home to make dinner.\n\nIt was then that the unthinkable happened. I have been saving this bottle of cold pivo (beer) to drink on my birthday. I took it out, found a glass, BUT there was no bottle opener. 8-(  This is a situation I will have to rectify tomorrow.\n\nWell, off to bed.\n\nHappy Labor Day weekend in the USA.\n\nHope all is well.

Of all times not to have my camera. If they are there again, I may buy one of their CDs. They were very good.\n\nMass was quieter this morning than last week. The singers who I enjoy were not there for some reason. The Mass was still enjoyable. The priest who said the Mass was the one who blessed my plaque to St. Blaise last year.\n\nI have a small problem with fruit flies. They seem to have attacked a peach that I have probably had for a day too long. The problem with fruit flies is that they are so small and fast. They seem to disappear when you get near them. The peach has been wrapped and trashed and I hope they have disbursed. I will have to watch my tomatoes, though.\n\nOne of my emails this morning was from my friend and colleague, Jai, who sent me a birthday e-card with suggestions on what I could do on my birthday, all of which involved \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 beer. He had read about my misfortune yesterday of not having a bottle opener. The card was very funny.\n\nWell, I want to report that my severe problem has been resolved. As you can see in the picture below, I am now the proud owner of a bottle opener. It has a fishing boat on it and says Croatia. I bought it at the souvenir shop across the street for 14.99 kuna (about $2.50). About an hour later that bottle was empty. I don\u2019t know what happened to it.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_721\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0101-e1346621860314.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-721\" title=\"DSCN0101\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0101-e1346621860314.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a> The birthday beer and a bottle opener.[/caption]\n\nI spent most of the day preparing for my class tomorrow. I have not taught that class in a while. I also had to run to the office to pick up book I needed. It is a 3 minute commute. I combined that trip with my bottle opener expedition and the purchase of some mayonnaise, which comes in a tube like tooth paste. I better not get those mixed up. I then had a light dinner. I made an egg and olive sandwich. That is when the beer disappeared somehow.\n\nTonight was an interesting evening. My landlord, Niko, who lives upstairs and in California, invited me to a gathering of English-speaking people. Several of them are members of the Dubrovnik Foreign Circle, a group of people living in Dubrovnik from other countries (US, Australia, Canada,...).  They gathered tonight to entertain a film crew who is filming a future PBS special on islands that time forgot. For example \u2013 islands with people but without cars. The film crew is staying at the Imperial Hilton and Niko is escorting them around. Tomorrow, they are going to spend some time in Dubrovnik but later they are going to an island off the coast that fits their criteria. I can\u2019t remember the name of the island but it is about an hour from Split. It is only 400 meters from  the mainland and its highest point is only 1 meter above sea level but, it has a hotel and people living there. Look for the special when it come out.\n\nI met a lot of very interesting people and it was an enjoyable evening. The film crew was from Chicago. It was nice of Niko to invite me.\n\nWell that is all for now. I am off to bed so I am well rested for tomorrow.\n\nHope all is well.

I woke up this morning at about 8:00 and I could have slept longer. I stayed up a little too late last night. I had no sooner gotten up than I heard my landlord calling from upstairs. I mentioned to him last night, after the gathering, that the bulb had burned out in the second bedroom ceiling light. I use that room as an office and Ed will be using it this weekend.  I had a bulb, but I couldn\u2019t get the globe off. I was afraid of breaking it. He had an electrician with him and he wanted to change the bulb.\n\nThe interesting thing was that they couldn\u2019t get the globe off either. The electrician tried to pry it off and it broke. Oh well, at least I didn\u2019t do it. They put the bulb in and said they would look for a replacement globe. When I came home from work tonight, there was a totally new fixture that looks easier to service.\n\nI got to the office a little after 10 and started printing some things I needed for class. I also looked for online (free) resources for the students to use as reading material. Books are very expensive here. So I am trying to find resources that they can use in place of the text book. I found enough for the first week.\n\nClass went very well. The students seem very enthusiastic. I also found a grader to help with the Java homework grading. She took the course last year and was recommended by TJ. She was happy to be doing anything with programming. She loves it.\n\nI gave out chocolate chip cookies today. Sue sent them in my suit case for my birthday. They were a real hit with my students and a couple of staff members who I saw early in the day. There is one left and I am saving it for our receptionist in the morning. She got the first one today and she can also have the last one.\n\nI had some trouble buying bus passes last week. I could not convince the lady that I lived here. They are very handy to have and cost 150 kuna (about $25) for 20 rides. I like to have them with me for when company comes. One of my friends went and bought them for me today. Last year I had no problem getting them myself. It probably depends on the person at the window.\n\nWhile on the way to get the tickets I was escorted through a maze of streets that take you almost to the Pile gate but avoids the heavily traveled main street. It was really nice and I think I will use it often. It is less chaotic.\n\nI went back to the office and worked for a little while, getting ready for tomorrow, and then went home. I put some laundry in, made dinner and realized I had forgotten to eat lunch. No wonder I was hungry. After cleaning up, I took out the garbage and went for a nice walk around the old town and harbor. It was a nice walk. I think I am going to turn in early tonight. It has been a busy but productive day.\n\nHope all is well and happy Labor Day in the USA.

I had my second class today. Most are students I know from a class last year. This is my class of juniors. They are a good group of students.\n\nSome have wondered what my schedule is like. Under the quarter system at RIT, I teach seven courses per year. In addition to that I am supposed to also provide service to RIT and to the IT community and do scholarship activities, which I do. I had planned on three courses here in Dubrovnik, but I am only teaching two, so I will teach three in the winter in Rochester and two more in the spring. So here is a typical week of my scheduled activities:\n\nI usually get up about 8:00 each day. After breakfast I do some work from home, usually course preparation, then go into the office.\n\nMonday (a light day) \u2013\n\nClass from 14:00 \u2013 16:00\n\nTuesday \u2013\n\nOffice hours from 13:00 \u2013 16:00\n\nClass from 16:00 \u2013 18:00\n\nWednesday (long day) \u2013\n\nOffice hours from 12:00 \u2013 14:00\n\nClass from 14:00 \u2013 16:00\n\nClass from 18:00 \u2013 20:00\n\nThursday \u2013\n\nClass from 10:00 \u2013 12:00\n\nOffice hours from 12:00 \u2013 15:00\n\nClass from 16:00 \u2013 18:00\n\nFriday \u2013\n\nMeetings\n\nI usually go for a walk in the evening and get to bed between 23:00 \u2013 24:00.\n\nTime outside the scheduled activities is spent on scholarship activities or class preparation.\n\nTonight I came home and cooked dinner then went for a walk into the old town. I booked a tour for Saturday for Eddie and I. We will be going to Mostar. Mostar is a city in Bosnia i Herzegovina that is like a Turkish town. It was practically destroyed during the 1991 war but has been rebuilt. Eddie arrives Friday afternoon, if Lufthansa is not on strike. Please pray that they are flying. They have been doing spot strikes and were on strike last Friday.\n\nIf you want to see some information about Mostar look at the following link\"\n\n<a title=\"Wikipedia on Mostar\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostar\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostar<\/a>\n\nThat is about all for today. It is 22:35, so I am right on schedule.\n\nHope all is well.

Last night on my way home from school, I noticed that it was getting cloudy but then it seemed to clear up. When I got up this morning the Weather Channel app on my iPad had a warning, \u201cPotential disruption due the thunderstorms from 12:01AM CEST to 11:59PM CEST.\u201d That about covers it, with two minutes to spare 8-) . CEST is Central European Summer Time (+6 from the US EDT). The warning went on to say that the chance of lightning was &gt; 60% with potential rainfall &gt; 30mm (about 1.2 inches).\n\nKevin Williams (10 NBC - Rochester) would have a field day here. The weather is usually the same every day at this time of year \u2013 sunny and hot. When rain is predicted it usually doesn\u2019t happen, but when it does, WATCH OUT! The water comes down the hills like crazy. You can be walking uphill in three to four inches of running water. I have only been here once when that happened and it was impossible to stay dry. So we will see what happens today. We really need the rain. Farmers here have had the same type of problems our farmers have \u2013 drought.\n\nThe sun is out with some clouds but I actually heard a couple rumbles of thunder out to sea. I will report later. This might be a good time to walk over to school so I don\u2019t get wet later.\n\nLATER\u2026.\n\nWhen I walked out of the apartment this morning, there was a fine but sparse mist in the air. I have seen this before. Nothing gets wet; you just feel it as it hits you and evaporates. This may lead to some rain but so far it has not. I stopped at the bakery for some bread in case it rained later and I didn\u2019t want to  stop then.\n\nLATER STILL \u2026.\n\nWell, it is now 23:45 and I have stayed up too late. I have class at 10 AM tomorrow. After my class ended at 20:00 I had agreed to meet one of my colleagues from RIT, Doug, at a hotel at the end of the promenade in Lapad. The hotel has this nice buffet and live ethnic music on Wednesday nights. Doug went last week and I went once last year with TJ and Doug and it was very nice. Guess what, no buffet tonight. Doug asked a waitress and she said it was over for the year \u2013 new manager.\n\nI suggested that we go to Restaurant Konavoka about half way down the promenade. So we went there and had dinner. I was there several times last year with TJ and when Sue came. The waitress remembered me. We ordered some wine and I had the chicken Dalmatian style and Doug had stuffed squid. Both meals were excellent. The sauce on my chicken was very good. I have not figured out what the spices are, but they are great. There is a little bottle of \u201cMediterranean spices\u201d in my kitchen that I love. I have no idea what they are, but they are great. I have to do some research. As we were leaving, it had finally started to rain. But it was like before, not enough to get wet.\n\nIt is now 23:53. In six minutes the warning will be over and my goal is to get to bed before midnight. Hope all is well.

I was concerned about a bora (wind) warning this morning, but the receptionist at ACMT told me not to worry because it is always over by noon. It was. So much for the warning until 11:59PM.\n\nI had a staff meeting first thing this morning. We do a video conference with both campuses, Dubrovnik and Zagreb. It went well. After the meeting, I worked on a technical problem that disrupted my lab on Thursday. I solved it. It will need a minor change to the configuration of the computers in the lab and the technical support person will do it on Monday morning for me. Good news. I expect class to go more smoothly next week. One problem that I have is that I can\u2019t try out changes on the same configuration we have here before I leave Rochester. We will have to get a test machine in Rochester.\n\nAfter that I spent the afternoon preparing for the arrival of Eddie. Marco, my driver, was going to pick me up at 16:00 to go to the airport. I spied his car and found him having coffee, so we sat together and talked until about 15:50 and left for the airport.\n\nWell, the best laid plans,\u2026. We went a short distance and stopped. It turned out there was an accident and traffic was held up about a half hour. Marco called a couple of his friends and found one at the airport who held up a sign with Eddie\u2019s name on it. When he found EdVard, all he said was \u201cwait here for my colleague\u201d.  Eddie waited and we got there quite late.\n\nI brought him back to the apartment and got him settled in. The drive from the airport along the sea is beautiful. We then walked around the old city for a while and ate a Taj Mahal (a Bosnian restaurant).\n\nHere is a picture. It is a little blurry because I had it set wrong for the waitress and I didn\u2019t want to ask her to do it again.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_738\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn01111.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-738\" title=\"DSCN0111[1]\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn01111.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Ed and Ed at dinner at Taj Mahal.

It worked out very well. I will catch up with the trip starting at the end of this entry.\n\nThis morning, Eddie and I slept in a bit and got up after nine.  We had gone to bed late and were tired last night. We decided that we would go for a swim before Mass this morning, so at about 10:00 we went to Donce beach, behind ACMT. We just took a short dip, but it felt great. We then came home to get ready for the 11:00 Mass at the Franciscan church.\n\nAs we were coming out of Mass an older woman who had been in the church asked me if I spoke English and said her passport and wallet had been stolen and her son was chasing the man who stole it. She asked if I could find the police. Now there are seldom police in the old city but there are usually two standing just outside the gate so I went to get them expecting that they would come and help the woman in some way.\n\nWell, I found the police officer in his usual spot. I explained the situation and he said to have her go to the police station and fill out a report, that way if they find it, they can return it to her, but there was nothing he could do now. Interesting response, I thought, correct probably, but interesting. So I started back and then remembered the part about the chase, so I went back and mentioned it and he said, you should have said that first. So he came. So always remember, mention the chase first.\n\nNow the whole thing came to an abrupt end, the son was back with his elderly mother, and they had to get the bus back to the cruise ship because it was leaving. The police officer looked mad at me and I just threw up my hands and said \u201csorry\u201d.\n\nThis is the first time I have ever seen anything like that happen in Dubrovnik. Remember when traveling; keep your valuables close to your body, even in Dubrovnik, which is noted for its safety.\n\nAfter that, Eddie and I needed gelato for breakfast. I don\u2019t think I have ever had ice cream for breakfast. It was very good, but they were out of my favorite flavor, stacciatella, so I had cookies instead. I may have a new favorite flavor. Sorry, Sue, I couldn\u2019t wait.\n\nAfter that, we decided to tour the west fort, outside the pile gate. I had never gotten to that the last time I was here. It was very nice and offered some nice views of the old city.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_741\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0259.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-741\" title=\"DSCN0259\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0259.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> view of Old Town Dubrovnik from the West Fort[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_742\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0283.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-742\" title=\"DSCN0283\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0283.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Lokrum from the West Fort[/caption]\n\nWe then walked toward my old neighborhood, around the new harbor (Gruz) and had lunch at a little pizza shop at the base on my old street where you can sit on the roof and watch the harbor. Sue, Kelly,  Laura and I ate there when they came last year. It made me miss my old apartment, but I am beginning to like where I am now also.\n\nFrom there we walked the promenade and continued around Babin Kuk (bob-in kook). I always thought that was a funny name. Al-in-in I think we walked for about four or five hours including the stop for lunch. We then walked over to my favorite grocery store, Tommy, and got some groceries including another 6L of drinking water. I got sun burn and my feet hurt but it was a good walk. We took the bus home.\n\nWhen we got home we made some Skype calls and then decided to go to the D\u2019Vino wine bar in the old city. We took a tour of Croatian wines and cheeses. It was fun and good. We then explored around the old city for a while. I saw that the hall of remembrance was open late tonight so we went in. It is a room to remember the 1991 \u2013 95 war and it is very moving. We then came home around 22:00\n\nThe wine tour involved these three wines.\n\n<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0288.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-743\" title=\"DSCN0288\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0288.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a>\n\n<\/div>\nIt was a good / full day.\n\nYesterday\u2019s trip was very interesting. I had bookd the trip when Eddie mentioned that he wanted to see some of the different cultures. The trips with this company have only eight participants, plus the driver/guide. There was a Canadian couple, a Turkish couple, An Irish couple and Eddie and I. We had a good time.\n\nThe first stop was in Neum, a city in a small strip of Bosnia that separates two pieces of Croatia. It was just a relief stop and Eddie and I had coffee while we waited to leave. There was a nice view from the terrace. We leave Croatia, enter Bosnia, leave Bosnia, enter Croatia then leave Croatia and enter Bosnia on our way. It is a crazy setup.\n\n<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0113.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-744\" title=\"DSCN0113\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0113.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a>More on the trip tomorrow.

We got up this morning and went for a swim in the sea at Dance (dahn-chea) beach. We then came home and I got ready for work.  I did some class preparation and went to class. Today was marketing photo day so I had my picture taken and they also came into my class and took pictures as I taught.\n\nAfter class, I did some follow up work and went home to meet Eddie who had been touring all day. We went to tour the Jewish Synagogue which is the second oldest synagogue in Europe (after Prague). They had old Torahs from the fourteenth thru the sixteenth century. I had never been in a Synagogue before.\n\nDubrovnik has had a fairly good relationship with other religions, although there was some repression early in its history. Things were reasonably harmonious until the Nazis appeared in 1941.\n\nEddie had made reservations at a good vegetarian restaurant called \u2026Nishta. The food was very good. I had gazpacho \u2013 a very good cold tomato soup and a drink made with orange, apple, carrot and ginger. Both were very good. The main course was an Indian dish.  After dinner we sat and talked with an American couple from Seattle. The tables are very close.\n\nWe then went for a walk and stopped for a beer along the Stradun. There we met a nice Swedish couple and talked to them for a while. We then returned home.\n\nNow for the continuing report on the weekend\u2026.\n\nAfter the stop at Neum, we continued on out journey to a fourth century Roman villa called Mogorjelo. This was a short stop tour the ruins. The ruins were built on top of first century Roman ruins. The villa was destroyed by the Visigoths. It was discovered in the early twentieth century when they were building a nearby rail line and began to dig out some dirt. It is very well preserved.\n\nOur tour guide grew up in this area of Bosnia and said that there was a nice museum here when it was Yugoslavia. Unfortunately it was destroyed during the war and the artifacts have been moved to another location.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_756\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0133.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-756\" title=\"DSCN0133\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0133.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Roman ruins cooking area[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_755\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0132.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-755\" title=\"DSCN0132\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0132.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Roman ruins sleeping quarters for the family.

This was an unauthorized stop, so don\u2019t tell the boss. Our guide knew of a couple of other places that he thought we might like to see and if we would take some time away from a couple of other stops we could stop at these sights.\n\nThe waterfall was very pretty and was actively used by people in the area as a swimming hole. The falls was pretty and was somewhat unique. I have not seen the falls with an overgrowth in the US. I have seen them several times here. Pictures will describe it better than I can. The only problem here was that we lost Eddie. You have to keep an eye on those kids (37 years old). Our guide was able to find him.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_761\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0145.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-761\" title=\"DSCN0145\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0145.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Eddie and I at the waterfalls[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_762\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0146.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-762\" title=\"DSCN0146\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0146.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Waterfall[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_758\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0147.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-758\" title=\"DSCN0147\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0147.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Waterfalls[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_759\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0148.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-759\" title=\"DSCN0148\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0148.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Interesting stone roof[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_760\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0149.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-760\" title=\"DSCN0149\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0149.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Top of the waterfalls[/caption]\n\nOur next stop was a quick stop near Medugore at the Herceg Ecological Village. It was interesting as a model village set up demonstrate different farming activities. We were only here about 15 minutes. They did have a very friendly miniature horse.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_766\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0161.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-766\" title=\"DSCN0161\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0161.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> The sign for the Eco Villiage[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_765\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0159-e1347311752122.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-765\" title=\"DSCN0159\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0159-e1347311752122.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a> A very friendly miniature horse[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_764\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0154.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-764\" title=\"DSCN0154\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0154.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> The farm yard at the Eco Villiage[/caption]\n\nWe then arrived at Medugore. This was intended to be only a one hour stop. That is why I decided against it last year. There is not really time to do anything that pilgrims consider important, like climb the hill, but this trip was really about going to Mostar. It was nice to stop here. Mass was going on in English and wherever you walked you could hear it. The Canadian couple was interested in the statue of the resurrected Jesus with the knee that is constantly wet, for no apparent reason. So I took them there so they could witness the miracle. It was also nice to be at Medugore on the feast of the Nativity of the BVM (8 September). I would like t have had more time there, but I plan on returning with Sue when she comes.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_763\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0162.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-763\" title=\"DSCN0162\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0162.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Eddie and I at Medugore[/caption]\n\nWe then left Medugore for Mostar and I will report on that in my next post.\n\nHope all is well, Ed","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":748,"wp:post_date":"2012-09-10 21:19:51","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-09-10 21:19:51","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"monday-9102012-work-day-part-ii-of-trip-to-mostar","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-09-10 21:19:51"},"wp:comment":[{"wp:comment_id":97,"wp:comment_author":"Laura","wp:comment_author_email":"lauramholden@gmail.com","wp:comment_author_url":"","wp:comment_author_IP":"23.25.55.45","wp:comment_date":"2012-09-11 20:52:32","wp:comment_date_gmt":"2012-09-11 20:52:32","wp:comment_content":"Looks like you're having a good trip so far!

They had predicted rain but it did not occur. When we got up, we decided to do some touring. We went to one museum that was closed on Tuesdays so we will try again tomorrow.\n\nSo we went to have an early lunch since we had skipped breakfast. We stopped at the pizza restaurant Olivia. We then went to tour a couple of churches. We started with the Dubrovnik Cathedral. It is a beautiful church. In the front behind the alter there is, what is called, \u201cthe treasury\u201d, but it contains relics. I had not seen this before when I was here. As Eddie said, you might expect that the way into the treasury was through the area that said exit \u2013 a little confusing.\n\nIn the treasury, there were several relics of St Blaise, his arm, his head and his leg. There was a relic of the true cross.  And many others including a \u201ccasket\u201d made of silver by a Dubrovnik silver smith that legend says contains the diaper of the baby Jesus. I am not sure I believe that one, and they do say it is legend.\n\nWe then went and toured the church of St. Blaise. That is a beautiful church also. After that we headed home. I had to get ready for work and Eddie was going sea kayaking and snorkeling. I worked until 18:30 then had a break until 20:00 so we caught up on each others' days. Then I had to attend the honors dinner across the street at Mimosa restaurant. It is always enjoyable to see the students with high averages. In order to qualify, students had to achieve a 3.4 average or above. It was a good evening \u2013 good company and good food. When I got home I found Eddie reading and with sore arms from the paddling earlier in the day.\n\nPART III of our trip to Mostar\n\nI will continue the story of our Saturday trip to Mostar.  After all of our stops we finally ended up in Mostar. Mostar is a city in Bosnia that is occupied by both Croats (Catholic) and Bosniaks (Muslim). This is a place that you see the other side of the 1991 - 1995 war. In Dubrovnik, you see the Croatian side where the Serbs attacked mercilessly. In Mostar you see where the Croats attacked. Some of the damage has not been repaired. Part of the reason seems to be lack of money and part seems to be that they want the reminders.  Bombed out buildings sit in the midst of other buildings.\n\nThe greatest symbol of the destruction is the famous bridge that was destroyed by the Croats. To demonstrate that hostility still exists, our guide (a Croat) said to notice that the last bomb to destroy the bridge came from underneath. In other words, the Bosniaks destroyed the bride themselves. I didn\u2019t see that in the video, they all seemed to come from above.\n\nWe had some time here. We stopped for dinner in the bazaar and enjoyed the food. We shared a table with the Canadian and Irish couples. We also had time to wander. We were warned to be careful of beggars and pick pockets.\n\nHere are a few pictures from Mostar (click to enlarge photos).\n\nIf you want to read about Mostar here is a Wikipedia link.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostar\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_776\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0165.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-776\" title=\"DSCN0165\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0165.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> A bombed out building that has never been repaired.[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_777\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0169-e1347398626607.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-777\" title=\"DSCN0169\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0169-e1347398626607.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a> A map of Mostar.

When we got up, Eddie and I decided we would go to the museum that was closed yesterday. It was the Rupe Granary and the Ethnographic Museum. Here is a link to a site about the museum.\n\n<a href=\"//www.galenfrysinger.com/croatia_dubrovnik_museum.htm\">http://www.galenfrysinger.com/croatia_dubrovnik_museum.htm<\/a>\n\nIt was very interesting.The granary was build to store grain for the population of Dubrovnik. They had a two year supply. Large containers were carved into the solid rock to provide cool, dry conditions best suited for storage of grain. The upper floors are dedicated to Croatian culture and there was part of a special exhibit dedicated to St. Blaise and the annual celebration. The part is in the rector's palace.\n\nAfter that we went home and I got ready for work then Eddie and I went to have coffee at Sesame before class. I had class and office hours today and my last class ended at 20:00.\n\nWhile I was working Eddie went to Lokrum Island and had a good time there, including swimming.\n\nWhen I got home, we had dinner at Domino steak house, my favorite restaurant in Dubrovnik. I had Steak Ragusa which is smothered in sauteed onions and has grilled vegetables. We had a very good Croatian red wine and sparkling water. We were there for a couple of hours and really enjoyed ourselves. One of my friends from ACMT works there as a host and we had a nice conversation with him also.\n\nNow back home and to bed. I have an early class tomorrow.\n\nPart IV of the trip\n\nNow the final installment of out trip to Mostar.\n\nOn the way home from Mostar we stopped at Pocitelji. I had stopped there last year after my trip to Medugore. It is an interesting Muslim town in the midst of Croat territory in Bosnia. Here are some pictures of this stop and a link from Wikipedia about the town.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po%C4%8Ditelj\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po%C4%8Ditelj<\/a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_809\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0221.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-809\" title=\"DSCN0221\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0221-e1347464772881.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a> This tree is 500 years old and stands in front of the Mosque in Pocitelji[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_810\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0222.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-810\" title=\"DSCN0222\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0222-e1347464880827.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a> The tower on the wall in Pocitelji[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_811\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0223.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-811\" title=\"DSCN0223\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0223.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> War destruction happened here also[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_803\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0224.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-803\" title=\"DSCN0224\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0224.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> The town showing the Mosque[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_804\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0226.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-804\" title=\"DSCN0226\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0226.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> The view in one direction.

As I was telling someone later, I didn\u2019t even know there was a 4:30. 8-) .  Anyway, I had to take Eddie to the airport. Marco, our driver, was here at 5:30. I hated to see Eddie leave. We had a good time this week and it was fun having him here. I think he had a good time also.\n\nWhen we got to the airport, the three of us had coffee and then we walked him to the gate. He had to get home in time to see the Arlington (MA) Day fireworks. He was also missing Andrea, Anna and Lucy. He has been away for three weeks, two in Munich for work and one here. Oh well, I hope he passes this way again. It was nice to have some together time.\n\nOn the way back from the airport, I arranged to have Marco pick me up on Sunday at 11:00 to go to get Sue. She comes in at 11:45. I am looking forward to seeing her. She will be staying with me for about two and a half weeks.\n\nWhen I got home I decided to rest for a while. I had no particular time I had to be in today. My only scheduled appointment was a 14:00 Skype call with my department chair back in Rochester. I used the time at home to catch up on laundry. I washed a white t-shirt with a yellow bed spread. Don\u2019t do that. I am not sure how I will get the color out of the shirt.\n\nThe weather today was not predicted to be good. There was a 70% chance of rain and we got it along with wind, thunder and lightning. When it rains here the lights flicker and even go out occasionally. It also cooled down, it is now (21:00) 18 degrees (66F) and it feels good. Everyone here is wearing jackets and I am still in shorts and a short-sleeve shirt. There were four alerts today on the weather channel app:\n\nPotential disruption due to wind until Fri, 11:59 PM\n\nPotential disruption due to rain until Fri, 11:59 PM\n\nPotential disruption due to wind until Fri, 11:59 PM\n\nPotential disruption due to rain until Fri, 11:59 PM\n\nThe last two look pretty much like the first two. It must mean they are serious about it. They were right. I went into the office about noon and worked on a couple technical problems. I have one I don\u2019t see to be able to solve. It will be there for another day.\n\nI got home just before 17:00 and decided to get some groceries, but by the time I got ready it was raining again so I decided to get dinner. I had a nice dinner and decided to go to Mass at 19:00. Today is the feast of The Exultation of the Cross and the priest wore red. It reminded me that I saw a relic of the true cross in the cathedral treasury, the other day. It made it special.\n\nAfter Mass I started to leave the old city and turned around to get a gelato at my favorite place. I was wearing an RIT shirt tonight. When the worker filled my cone, he saw the RIT and asked if I was at ACMT. \u201cYes,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cFaculty?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cDo you teach American students?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I teach Croatian students.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never seen you before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came last year, I am here from August through November, just the Fall quarter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo charge.\u201d\n\nWe spoke for a couple minutes. I thought that was very nice of him not to charge me.I had heard that that store gave a discount to ACMT faculty, 7kn instead of 10kn, but I have never asked for it.\n\nWell that is all for now. I thought I would leave you with a couple weather pictures.  Remember to click on the picture to enlarge it.\n\nHope all is well.

I had been out every night with Eddie and I think it caught up with the old man. I slept until about 10:00 this morning, which is unusual for me.\n\nI got up this morning and decided to give the apartment a good cleaning. I swept all the way through, shook the rugs, cleaned the sinks, toilet and shower and generally straightened up. The apartment looks pretty good.  Did I mention Sue was coming tomorrow?\n\nAfter I finished cleaning the apartment, I did some school work for a while. The work involved things here and in Rochester. We are going through our accreditation review in Rochester and there was a need for more information, which I provided.\n\nAfter school work, I boiled some eggs for a sandwich later and then I went to get groceries. The store I like is about a 30 minute walk from my new apartment. It is down by the harbor where I used to live. It is a nice walk. One of the things I needed was some water which I like to buy in a 6L bottle (about 1.6 gallons). This is heavy. I brought my backpack to carry the heaviest things. Well, I bought too many things, so I took the bus home. On the bus I ran into one of my colleagues, Doug who had been down on the promenade for the afternoon.\n\nWhen I got home. I made egg and olive for my sandwich and also made some croutons for salads or soup. I can't eat a whole loaf of bread so I always have a stale piece around that I keep for this purpose. I started making croutons last year. The don't sell anything like that here but they are easy to make.\n\nWhat is funny about this is that I had forgotten that I knew how to make croutons. Last year I mentioned to Sue when she was here in Dubrovnik that I wished I had croutons.  So she made some. It was like this watershed of knowledge fell over me and brought me back to my youth in Fulton, NY. That was before you could buy croutons in the store, you know, back in the stone age (1950's). My Aunt Hazel lived next door to Moon's bakery on Oneida Street and she would always have some of their good bread left over. Aunt Hazel was a fantastic cook and often would let me cook with her. She taught me how to make croutons, among other things. Seeing Sue make these brought all this back, So, I continue to make croutons over here.\n\nCroutons are easy to make and there is no one recipe. Experiment a little. The basic recipe is a follows: Cube the bread and fry the cubes in a little butter. You had better write that down 8-) . The variation I use here is to use olive oil and butter, add some crushed garlic and those Mediterranean spices I mentioned in an earlier post. So when Sue arrives tomorrow she can have a salad with croutons. It has been too warm to make soup, but soon.\n\nSue left today from Rochester. The Jet Blue flight was an hour and a half late.There was a problem with the plane and they had to send another. When I saw that the plane had left, I went over to Mass at the Franciscan church followed by a little walk. When I got back I called her at JFK and we talked for a while. She was at the Aer Lingus gate from where her next flight was leaving and she was looking for food.  She has some time before the next flight.\n\nI am a little worried tomorrow because we have one of those weather alerts: Potential disruption due to wind in effect from 12:01 AM CEST SUN until 2PM CEST SUN. maximum-gust-speed&gt;65 km h; Strong bora wind with stormy gusts. Sue's plane is scheduled to arrive at 11:45. The bora can close the airport and the planes divert to Split which is a four hour bus ride away. Let's hope that does not happen. The bora usually ends before noon.\n\nWell, off to bed now.\n\nHope all is well.

Most everything went smoothly, although the landing here in Dubrovnik  today was rough. Aside from being very tired--hard to sleep when you're that crowded--it was OK. I went from Rochester to JFK, to Dublin, then Croatia. It was about 18 travel hours, but several were layover time. The flight to JFK was so smooth that about 40 minutes into the 50 minute flight, a lady 80+ yrs old, next to me, said,  \"Do you know what the hold-up is?  I can't figure out why we haven't moved yet.\"  She was so relieved when I told her we were flying and almost there.\n\nEd and driver, Marco met me about noon today and we drove the 1/2 hour to his apartment. I was a little nauseous from the landing and the winding roads so I immediately laid down and slept two hours.\n\nWhen I got up, I felt a lot better and we went for a swim-- just a 5 min walk away, near Ed's campus. The weather here is back to a sunny, breezy, 80 degrees, so it felt good and helped me wake up.  Just have to remember not to talk when I'm facing TOWARDS the high waves. Mouth full of salt water!\n\nWe went to that Domino's Steak House for a great dinner.  It's in the old walled town and you can eat outside. Wonderful steak with a mushroom sauce and baked potato \"in tin foil\".  That's actually what the menu said,instead of mentioning the whipped sour cream, garlic, and chive topping??\n\nAfter dinner, we went to Mass at the Franciscan chapel, which is always beautiful, although  have to admit, I was fading a little from fatigue. I normally try to get something out of every homily, believing something was meant for me to hear.  Maybe it takes longer when it's all in Croatian.  I did recognize Kum-Ba Ya and Come Holy Ghost.\n\nConveniently, the Franciscans built their 1600's chapel across from a gelato shop.  We just ended our day there and I'm going to sleep early!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_852\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0713.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-852\" title=\"DSCN0713\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0713.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Sue getting ready to write tonight's blog post.[/caption]","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":850,"wp:post_date":"2012-09-16 19:09:33","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-09-16 19:09:33","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"sunday-9162012-sue-is-here","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-09-16 19:09:33"},"wp:comment":[{"wp:comment_id":107,"wp:comment_author":"abizeleth","wp:comment_author_email":"elizabeth.hane@gmail.com","wp:comment_author_url":"http://offtodubrovnik.wordpress.com","wp:comment_author_IP":"65.37.4.69","wp:comment_date":"2012-09-16 19:56:46","wp:comment_date_gmt":"2012-09-16 19:56:46","wp:comment_content":"Ha ha!

Ed woke me up at 9:30 am, after 12 hours of sleep!, so I would get myself off jet lag and on a Croatian schedule. I'm still awake, so I guess it worked.  I do have to admit that at 3:30 this afternoon, I had to \"re-start\" my day with a pot of coffee.\n\nWe took a walk, before Ed went to work, from one gate of the Old Town to the other and around the harbor. I then walked over to the college with him to bring the chocolate chip cookies I had baked for his staff and students. They're quite the hit here--apparently hard to find, in spite of all the bakeries.\n\nI went back to the apartment to unpack and \"make myself at home.\" I dampened a few pieces of clothing that had gotten very wrinkled and hung them on the clothesline to dry, swept our little patio area, and enjoyed my afternoon coffee with my novel, \"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\" (thanks, Andrea). Somehow neither one of us read it in HS.\n\nIt was too nice a day not to get a swim in, so I went back to the Old Town hoping to remember how to get to the door in \"the wall\"  leading to one of my favorite swim spots. I found it right away and, even though it was crowded with much younger people than myself, I went in anyway. I was encouraged by the \"diving lady\". Kelly and Laura will remember her and I will tell the story another night.\n\nEd and I made dinner together at the apartment tonight and then made plans for a weekend trip to Plitvice Lakes National Park. This coming weekend seemed to be all booked up, so we plan to go on Sept 28-30th. We got in another walk around Old Town tonight also, including the gelato shop. Lots of live music around every corner and the streets were as busy as in daylight.\n\nSo that's been my day--walks, swimming, reading, eating, more walks, gelato--it's a rough life, but somebody's got to live it...\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_858\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0818.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-858\" title=\"DSCN0818\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0818.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Swim spot off the old wall[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_857\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0814.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-857\" title=\"DSCN0814\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0814.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Ed's kitchen[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_856\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0813.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-856\" title=\"DSCN0813\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0813.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Ed's living room[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_859\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0806.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-859\" title=\"DSCN0806\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0806.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Ed' patio[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":854,"wp:post_date":"2012-09-17 20:20:53","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-09-17 20:20:53","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"monday-9172012-sues-first-full-day","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-09-17 20:20:53"}}

Restarting my day with a pot of coffee at 3:30 pm! It did keep me awake---I was still awake at 11:30pm, at 12:30am ...so today I had my last cup at noon and I'll see how this works.\n\nYes, there is A cloud in the sky. That probably means we may get rain some time in the next week. I 'll keep everyone posted.\n\nThis am, before Ed went to work, we decided to take a walk up behind his apartment to see where the trail to Mt. Srd starts. We wouldn't have time for the hike up the mountain today, but hope to climb it this weekend. It was a perfect 72 degrees when we awoke, but by the time we went, it had to be 80+ in the sun. Just to get to the trail, I counted 468 stairs! That's not even counting a lot of walking on inclined stoned walkways, where they didn't build stairs. SO, I told Ed that it will have to be much cooler and cloudier before I could make the climb up the mountain. I'm used to hiking in the Adirondacks, but the trails are in shady woods.\n\nI got a late afternoon swim in again behind Ed's campus. Tried to mail a couple of postcards, but the PO closed at 3 pm. I probably won't mail as many this year, as this blog keeps us in contact.\n\nWe're planning on dinner tonight at a place near the Ploce Gate that we spotted last year, but never tried. You sit outdoors, under a beautiful, huge tree, overlooking the harbor.\n\n3 hours later...We just returned from a wonderful dinner at that restaurant, Revelin Klub,it's called. We both had turkey gorgonzola with roasted potatoes, peppers, zucchini and onions. The views were amazing, as you'll see in the photos that we'll add.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_866\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0715.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-866\" title=\"DSCN0715\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0715.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Sue and I having dinner[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_867\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0719-e1347996087474.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-867\" title=\"DSCN0719\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0719-e1347996087474.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a> A beautiful ship moored outside the old harbor.

Ed loaned me his bus pass to use to get to that area, as I wanted to save my walking for a trip around the peninsula. Bathing suit under the clothes today; I plan to hit some beaches.\n\nI set out around noon and didn't get back to the apartment until after 5pm. I got off the bus this am at \"the Promenade\" on Lapad. I felt a little nostalgic for the old apartment when I went by the foot of the hill where it's located, and for the whole area, as the bus passed \"Ed's harbor.\" I headed down the familiar promenade, past that area's favorite gelato shop (that would wait til later). \n\nMy first stop was the Lapad Beach, the very first beach I swam at last year.  This time, however, I did not make the mistake of sitting on a $6 chair with a $6 umbrella. I set towel and backpack up along a break wall and got my water shoes out--my best investment from last year. Today's beaches were going to be \"walk-in\" ones, and the bottom is very small pebbles or coarse sand.\n\nThe water is a little cool, but not at all hard to get into.  I swam a short time, dried off, then began my trek along the shaded path,  with the beautiful sea and pine trees to my left. I decided that I had lots of time, so I stopped at the outdoor eating area for Hotel More, and had a delicious Greek salad.\n\nMy next stop was the small swimming area at the end of the peninsula.  No name, but local people seem to know it's there and it's a jewel!  Blue-green water with a white rock bottom and wonderful mountain views. Again, I swam for a while, dried off and headed for Cava Beach, which is on the side of the peninsula,headed back.  I asked about kayak rentals, which were under $7/hr. Unfortunately, there wasn't an hour left before they closed, so they told me to come back another day. I wish that I had told them I'd pay the money and just kayak for whatever time was left. I still think it was good deal and the waters were very calm here compared to around Old Town where Eddie went last week. Oh well, I did get a nice swim in here.\n\nI walked past Copacabana Beach (I could practically hear Barry Manilow singing). Not the kind of beach where I like to swim --way too busy. Somewhere after this I took the high road, when I should have taken the low road, close to the harbor. I ended up walking through a RV and tent campground, that I knew I shouldn't be seeing and the harbor was farther away.  Occasionally, I could look down and see the path I should have been on, but the only way to get to it was by climbing tall fences. I didn't want headlines in local papers to read :\"Middle-aged American Woman Arrested on Private Property Near Harbor!\" So I continued on my not-so-scenic road, at least being able to tell I was headed in the right direction.\n\nI eventually worked my way to familiar territory-the promenade, with it's gelato stand. I enjoyed a small scoop of strawberry, then headed to the grocery store.  I bought way to many things for the bus trip home. Besides stuffing my backpack, I was carrying a LARGE container of water and an even bigger bag of toilet paper.  I was not a comfortable sight on the bus, having to stand much of the trip.\n\nAnyway, I made it back and Ed is due home shortly.  We're going out for pizza! Same place Eddie went with Ed last week--Tabasco--4 cheese pizza, delicious.\nI promise a shorter blog tomorrow. The rain should keep me quiet.","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":872,"wp:post_date":"2012-09-19 20:08:49","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-09-19 20:08:49","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"wednesday-91912-revisited-lapad","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-09-19 20:08:49"}}

I colored my hair from a package of Croatian hair color, not being positive what the color or instructions said. I should have done this before my trip, but ran out of time.\n\nAnyway, I sat around this AM worried that I might be turning some weird shade of purple, or greenish! or some off shade of red, \"that nature never intended\" (in Ed's aunt's words). But I think it came OK.  While it was drying, I sat on the upper part of our patio, where we have an interesting \"fake water view\".  It's actually a large screen, with a mirror in the middle. On the screen are continuous water scenes, some very blue, some golden or red at sunset. Sadly, these scenes are alternated with bombing scenes from the '91 war (lest we forget!)   We can actually see a little real water to the side of the screen.\n\nEd stopped back at the apt. during his break and we warmed up a slice of last night's pizza for lunch. That's a nice thing about him living so close this year-he can stop home easily. When he went back to work, I walked up to the park behind his building and read.  No swimming today--it cooled off dramatically after an overnight rain.\n\nTonight we met a colleague of Ed's from work at a restaurant on the Lapad peninsula.  We took a bus down and back. We had a wonderful time with his friend, Paul, and his girlfriend, Sanja. It was their first time at the restaurant, but we had been their before.  We were happy this time to have indoor seating with the cool evening.  Ed had a grilled tuna steak and I had chicken, both cooked \"Dalmation-style\", which a friend pointed out last year must mean \"with lots of garlic!\"  Anyway, great company and great food.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_875\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0835.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-875\" title=\"DSCN0835\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0835.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Yesterday's view from Cava Beach[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_876\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0839.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-876\" title=\"DSCN0839\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0839.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Our fake water view[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_877\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0844.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-877\" title=\"DSCN0844\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0844.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Dinner at the Konavoka on Lapad[/caption]","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":874,"wp:post_date":"2012-09-20 20:55:49","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-09-20 20:55:49","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"thursday-9202012-quiet-day-dinner-with-friends","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-09-20 20:55:49"}}

Then, I mailed a couple of postcards and we even had time to sit outside at a cafe for coffee. Everything was within a couple of blocks. Liking this location more &amp; more.\n\nLast night, Ed's friends mentioned a good place for a fish dinner and I had my mouth watering for that when Ed got home from his meetings. We placed a couple of phone calls before we set out to the \"fish\" restaurant at the harbor.  We called my mom in New Hartford, NY and also called Father Tom Brown in Brazil for his birthday. Both were very excited to hear from us.\n\nNow the menu said: \"Small Fish Fried\", and not needing a Large \"Fish Fry\", we both ordered that, plus a salad and drink each.  Good thing we at least had those, because I could not even look at the bucket of tiny fried SARDINES!  Ed was good and had some and I just looked away at the scenery at the harbor.  But, I made up for this meal later.\n\nAfter Skyping with Emily and Margaret, we took the gondola (cable car) up to see the sunset on Mt. Srd. This was absolutely breathtaking! We did first walk through the Napoleonic Fort from which the men of Dubrovnik defended their city in 1991. There's a museum there and the video is quite alarming--especially when you see places we now know being bombed, like the churches in the Old Town and the Hilton Imperial where we were today.\n\nWe ended on the roof watching the sunset beyond the islands, then caught it near the famous cross, and from the outdoor restaurant.  This is where I more than made up for the fish dinner with chocolate walnut cake and wine--actually, not bad together!

Medjugorje is in Bosnia, but the way the coastal region is divided up, you go in and out of Croatia and Bosnia a couple of times. All of this made us late for the 11 AM Mass at the church, but, thankfully, we made it for some of it.\n\nMass was held outside with today's perfect weather and it was beautiful.  There were hundreds of people from all over the world in the amphitheater  and about a dozen priests on the altar. It seemed to be all in Italian-the service and the singing.  At Eucharist time, they had everyone form lines down both sides of each of several aisles.  The priests then all came down and began distributing communion up and down the aisles. In spite of the numbers, it was very personal and moving.\n\nAfter Mass, we went into the church to see the altar of Mary, which was also quite beautiful.  We then walked around the grounds to see the wonderful mosaics depicting events in the life of Jesus and the Stations of the Cross. We stopped for a short time at the famous Cross of the Risen Christ.   We decided to come back there later, as it was very busy. At that point I was not seeing the miracle of the \"weeping Knee\", but I did when I returned.\n\nWe had packed our own lunch so we went next to the picnic table area provided and ate there.  Every table seemed to have a group speaking a different language. We ate our peanut butter sandwiches, cheese, and oranges and drank our bottles of water (warm by now). We began our walk across town to the Hill of the Apparition. I'll write more about this tomorrow, as we came home renewed in spirit, but exhausted!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":893,"wp:post_date":"2012-09-22 20:24:24","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-09-22 20:24:24","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"saturday-9222012-medjugorje-part-i","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-09-22 20:24:24"}}

I lit a candle there in memory of my sister, Marilyn, who took \"Bernadette\" as her Confirmation name.\n\nWe had breakfast at an Irish pub-a great ham omelet, a few french fries, and toast. I took a short nap in early afternoon while Ed did some school work. We then walked to the East-West Beach for a picnic sponsored by his college student council. I got to meet a few of his students--they seem to have a good rapport--one invited us kayaking. I also got to meet several faculty members. They had cooked out hamburgers and sausages and had several kinds of drinks. It was a nice time.\n\nTo continue about Medjugorje yesterday,  we walked through the town, past many little restaurants and gift shops to find the hill.  I had not brought my rosary from home, so I did pick up a pretty blue one to bring with me.  The MANY souvenir shops, especially right up to the base of the hill, are a little bothersome. On the other hand, when you come down, you do feel like you want to bring something home to share your experience with others.\n\nAnyway, if there is some commercialism about the town, you feel none of this on the climb up or at the top.  It is a rugged walk ,the path embedded with large rocks. People are quiet and prayerful, stopping occasionally to rest or pray at the depictions of the Joyful Mysteries of the Rosary.\n\nWhen you reach the spot of the 1981 apparitions, there is a beautiful white statue of Mary, surrounded by a small fence. The sight of this image, against the blue sky, overlooking the small town and  quiet countryside of grape vineyards, is something I will never forget. It is hard to explain how emotionally moving this was, but it seemed to bring every one of us to tears. The only sound was a small group saying the rosary and then softly singing \"Amazing Grace\", although I'm not sure what the language was. Ed and I picked a spot to the side for a while and said our own rosaries. He had one hand made by his Uncle Jack.\n\nWe started down after about a half hour, past steady streams of silent climbers,  some very old, some quite young, many making the journey barefoot. When we returned to the church area, we went back to try to touch the Cross of the Risen Jesus. Ed had been up to it before and, because lines in the hot sun were long again, he waited on the benches.\n\nI waited for about 45 minutes and with the sun shining right on the knee area, the highest area you can reach, I could see that droplets of water did keep coming out of this metal cross!  Apparently, they've had metal experts examine this, and there is no scientific explanation for it.  I thought I would keep waiting until I could actually touch the droplets, but some people were staying there for extremely long periods, touching the water slowly and individually with dozens of small handkerchiefs.\n\nSo, what had started as a beautiful spiritual moment was beginning to become annoying, and I stepped out of line because I did not feel that \"annoyance\" was a feeling I should be having at that time. And as I watched the sun gleam on the droplets, a thought came to me to question more not IF Jesus was crying, but what things in the world would make Him cry and the importance of seeing His tears in others.  Those thoughts have stayed with me, we feel we had a very blessed day,  and will treasure our time in Medjugorje.\n\nIf you would like to see this for yourself  <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KeuCHi-pKM\">here<\/a> <\/strong> is a video someone else took on Youtube.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_900\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0801.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-900\" title=\"DSCN0801\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0801.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Outside Mass at Medjugorje[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_901\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn08131-e1348424589143.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-901\" title=\"DSCN0813\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn08131-e1348424589143.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a> Sue outside the church of St. James[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_902\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0815.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-902\" title=\"DSCN0815\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0815.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> The beginning of the trail up Apparition Hill[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_904\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0847-e1348424700861.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-904\" title=\"DSCN0847\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0847-e1348424700861.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a> Stream of people heading up Apparition Hill[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_903\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0821.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-903\" title=\"DSCN0821\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0821.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Pilgrims before the statue of the Blessed Mother on Apparition Hill[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_905\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0849.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-905\" title=\"DSCN0849\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0849.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Ed praying rosary near the statue[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_898\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0822-e1348424386532.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-898\" title=\"DSCN0822\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0822-e1348424386532.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a> The resurrected Jesus with the weeping knee[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_899\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0825.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-899\" title=\"DSCN0825\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0825.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Stop in Pocitelj on the way home[/caption]","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":896,"wp:post_date":"2012-09-23 18:40:23","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-09-23 18:40:23","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"sunday-9232012-medjugorje-part-ii-student-faculty-picnic","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-09-23 18:40:23"}}

I took advantage by doing 4 loads- which means 8 dryer loads, since you can only put in half at a time.  So I kept checking for things to hang outside.  There's limited space so as things dried and could be taken off the line, I put up a few more things, and threw some in the dryer.  All in all, I spent over 3 hours doing this, but I got a lot done.  While waiting in between, I have almost finished \"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\".--great book if you've never read it.\n\nBefore Ed went to work this afternoon we tried to take a walk in the Old Town. Had he still been living near the harbor, he could have known the number of cruise ships in today and been forewarned about the crowds. We could barely get through the gates. ( made my mom's question last night even funnier: \"Do you ever see any other tourists over there?\")\n\nWe decided to go to a much less crowded place--a park behind Ed's college building.  Surprisingly, he had never been through it.  Very pretty vegetation, lots of shaded park benches, and a glorious view of the sea. Plus, no crowds to walk around or through.\n\nI've found this very confusing here until Ed explained it today. When people are walking towards each other, we normally step to the right. If the people coming in the opposite direction do the same, everyone's OK. But some people here keep stepping to the left and we almost collide.  Ed said it depends on which side of the road they drive on in their home country.  Brits and Japanese go to the left.  Croations go to the right like we do.  Interesting!  So people aren't just being rude and stubborn.\n\nWe went out to eat tonight at one of Ed's favorites--Mimosa.  We both had delicious beef dinners, grilled vegetables, and potatoes. After dinner we walked to the other side of town to a large supermarket-similar to ours at home. The only thing we had to ask for help with was cream for my coffee. We  didn't know the word for it and I think the first thing we picked up was actually \"sour cream\", which would not have been good.\n\nNo photos today.  They would have just been of me hanging wash, bumping into people, or looking confused in the dairy aisle, so you're not missing anything.","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":910,"wp:post_date":"2012-09-24 19:40:13","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-09-24 19:40:13","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"monday-9242012-breezy-day-for-wash","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-09-24 19:40:13"},"wp:comment":[{"wp:comment_id":127,"wp:comment_author":"abizeleth","wp:comment_author_email":"elizabeth.hane@gmail.com","wp:comment_author_url":"http://offtodubrovnik.wordpress.com","wp:comment_author_IP":"65.37.4.69","wp:comment_date":"2012-09-25 04:58:23","wp:comment_date_gmt":"2012-09-25 04:58:23","wp:comment_content":"We used to check the Port of Dubrovnik webpage pretty often - the even had a color-coded system (Green, Yellow &amp; Red) to tell you how many people were expected from Cruise Ships that day.\n\nLooks like it's still there on the harbor website: \nhttp://www.portdubrovnik.hr/girica1.php\n\nJust click on the month you want and then the button at the bottom, and it will download a .pdf file with a whole lot of information about the various ships arriving and leaving.

After a few cool days, it really warmed up again, and while my poor husband was teaching, I walked to the beach where Sunday's picnic had been held. The waves were wild.  You'd stand at the shore in ankle-deep water and get a wave up to your waist. Grown men were getting swept off their feet. It was great fun (both to watch and then go in).\n\nIn the AM, Ed and I went exploring in Old Town to try to find a 1225 chapel we read about in a travel book. It survived the 1667 earthquake and is the only purely Romanesque building left in Dubrovnik. It originally housed the first Dominican monks to arrive here. We did find it, but not much of it can be seen because of newer buildings around it.  Apparently, it can be seen better from the wall, which we haven't walked yet this year.\n\nWe had a wonderful dinner tonight at Ragusa 2, one of the restaurants on the narrow-upper side streets of Old Town. Ed had squid and I had fish fillet (no head, no bones, no sardines!).

I was so dizzy today by the time I reached Lapad, seeing everything go by in the windows backwards. Even the beautiful sea didn't look good that way.\n\nI was on a mission to make the first of 11 plans I've written down for my last week here--sort of a \"Croatia Bucket List\". We've decided that getting to Plitvice National Park is going off the list. As much as I'd like to see it, we'd have to drive all day Friday, then back all day on Sunday. Neither one of us really wanted to spend that long in a car. Plus I realized on last Saturday's drive that I don't do so well riding in standard shift cars or on winding mountain roads (and I was facing forwards then). So, plenty to do and see in Dubrovnik...!\n\nThat's what took me to Lapad this AM. I was going back to a booth that advertised a \"Three-Island Fish Picnic\"--last year they approached me everyday about going on this, but we ran out of time. I think they were shocked that they didn't even have to try to sell me on it today-I know the hype by heart-I just walked up and booked it for Friday. I also swam at Lapad Beach for a little while. Missed the high waves, but got over my bus ride.\n\nI made dinner at home tonight. I know, it's about time. Ed had almost 2 hours between classes, so it worked out well again for him to come home. We had salad with cucumbers, apples, tomatoes,and his famous croutons. Main course was chicken, cooked with onions, red peppers, garlic in a light cream sauce (my coffee cream). Also had buttered carrots and grilled potatoes. Amazing what I can do when I have nothing else to do!\n\nIn a little while we're going for a wine tasting. Can't wait to see what wine tastes like--Ha-ha!\n\nJust got back. The tasting was very nice. Along with the wine we got a meat and cheese platter. I can actually say that I've tasted wild boar now!! (in a pepperoni form, anyway)\nThey explain all about the different wines, how they're grown from the same grapes that get varying amounts of sunshine. This one has a mild fruity taste, this one a wood flavored, this one more full-bodied and....blah, blah, blah...does anyone really care after that point? Did I mention it was good?\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_937\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn08491.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-937\" title=\"DSCN0849[1]\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn08491.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Dinner at home[/caption][caption id=\"attachment_938\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn08551.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-938\" title=\"DSCN0855[1]\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn08551.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Wine tasting[/caption][caption id=\"attachment_939\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn08591.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-939\" title=\"DSCN0859[1]\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn08591.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Changing of the guard[/caption]&nbsp;","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":933,"wp:post_date":"2012-09-26 20:28:42","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-09-26 20:28:42","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"wednesday-9262012-plans-for-my-last-week","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-09-26 20:28:42"},"wp:comment":[{"wp:comment_id":133,"wp:comment_author":"Ed Holden III","wp:comment_author_email":"edholden@gmail.com","wp:comment_author_url":"","wp:comment_author_IP":"108.49.146.113","wp:comment_date":"2012-09-27 01:17:51","wp:comment_date_gmt":"2012-09-27 01:17:51","wp:comment_content":"Another edition of Travel So Fed. :)\n\nGlad you're having a good time!","wp:comment_approved":1,"wp:comment_type":"","wp:comment_parent":0,"wp:comment_user_id":0,"wp:commentmeta":[{"wp:meta_key":"akismet_result","wp:meta_value":false},{"wp:meta_key":"akismet_history","wp:meta_value":"a:4:{s:4:\"time\";d:1348708671.906425952911376953125;s:7:\"message\";s:28:\"Akismet cleared this comment\";s:5:\"event\";s:9:\"check-ham\";s:4:\"user\";s:0:\"\";}"},{"wp:meta_key":"jabber_published","wp:meta_value":1348780169},{"wp:meta_key":"akismet_history","wp:meta_value":"a:4:{s:4:\"time\";d:1348780169.6976330280303955078125;s:7:\"message\";s:47:\"epholden changed the comment status to approved\";s:5:\"event\";s:15:\"status-approved\";s:4:\"user\";s:8:\"epholden\";}"}]},{"wp:comment_id":134,"wp:comment_author":"abizeleth","wp:comment_author_email":"elizabeth.hane@gmail.com","wp:comment_author_url":"http://offtodubrovnik.wordpress.com","wp:comment_author_IP":"65.37.4.69","wp:comment_date":"2012-09-27 03:28:37","wp:comment_date_gmt":"2012-09-27 03:28:37","wp:comment_content":"Plitvice is amazing - might be worth considering driving from Zagreb sometime on a future visit, though, as it's only about 90 minutes from there.

I rode the bus to the promenade. While walking the path, I got to see the big sailing ship out at a distance.  When it went right by our apartment area the other day, I couldn't grab a camera fast enough. I had packed a light lunch and stopped to eat it at a park along the way--orange and apple slices, gouda cheese and some ice water.  I had frozen a bottle of water last night.  It worked nicely as an ice pack and then as my drink. (You think these carefree days are without some planning?)\n\nKayak Rental was only 40 kuna--not even $7, and I could have it for an hour. I asked the woman who rented them out if she'd take my photo and the keep my backpack behind the bar with her. That's another problem with going places alone.  I didn't want to leave it on a chair with camera, money, etc. And I wasn't going to bring it all in the kayak in case I flipped it over.\n\nThese sea kayaks are very steady compared to what I'm used to on Pleasant Lake. i first set off past Copacabana Beach and towards the beautiful suspension bridge.  Occasionally a larger boat was headed for the bridge, and gradually their wake would reach my kayak and rock it back and forth.  Fun! It was exciting to glance down as the paddle entered the water and see the aqua blue water, right down to the white rock bottom. So different than than the dark waters at our lake and you never see the bottom there.\n\nI then paddled in the other direction, passing where I entered at Cava Beach and saw more swimming areas I didn't know about. One was a child-friendly,  gradually sloping beach and the other--let's just say the folks are never going to have to worry about uneven tan lines!\n\nIt was warm kayaking, although as I paddled,my legs were getting splashed.  A swim felt really good afterwards. While headed back, I found the Babin Kuk bus #6, so I figured I had enough exercise, considering the heat, and rode back.\n\nEd got home from work at 6 PM.  We raced through Old Town to try to catch the sunset at the beach bar, but it went behind some clouds.  Still pretty.  We then walked back through the town, heard some great music from the steps of St Blaise Church, then headed to Sesame Restaurant.  Its another favorite, right on Ed's route to work.  Delicious \"Dalmation\" roast beef dinner. Ended with a moon-lit walk back.  Great way to end the day.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_946\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0862.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-946\" title=\"DSCN0862\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0862.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> The big sailing boat[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_947\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0868.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-947\" title=\"DSCN0868\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0868.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Sue getting her kayak[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_943\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0872.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-943\" title=\"DSCN0872\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0872.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> I paddled almost all the way to this bridge[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_944\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0873-e1348779786187.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-944\" title=\"DSCN0873\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0873-e1348779786187.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a> Sue at the sunset off the city wall[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_945\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0878.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-945\" title=\"DSCN0878\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0878-e1348780026704.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a> The moon above the wall[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":942,"wp:post_date":"2012-09-27 21:07:46","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-09-27 21:07:46","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"thursday-9272012-kayaking-dinner-at-sesame","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-09-27 21:07:46"}}

We were told to report for our \"Three Island Fish Picnic Excursion\" at 9:30 this AM.  We got there at 9:20 and the girl seemed shocked.  \"Wow, you're early.  Come back around 9:45.\"  So we sat around for 25 minutes watching early AM swimmers, and then returned. After a few minutes, she began to walk us down to the harbor for our boat. A man came to meet her and said that instead of 10AM departure, it would be a little later. So close to 10:30 we took off.\n\nThe boat was not that full, so we had our choice of seats. We chose ones right near the front, where we got the sea breeze, but also had a roof for shade. They immediately came around with plastic cups and poured some Rakija for everyone (liquor at 10:30 am). They also had boxes of wine that you could help yourself to all day-and some people did--we at least waited til late afternoon. It tasted just like you might expect wine out of a box served in a plastic cup to taste. These Croatians! Two things are very important to them--their faith (note the statue of Mary on our boat) and their wine (note the boxes right under the statue!)\n\nOur first stop was the island of Lopud. We had 2 1/2 hours here--supposed to be 3, but that time thing).  We went off exploring a 1483 church and monastery.  Before Columbus ever set out, this church was standing there!  Things like that amaze me. The monastery ended up being under repair and off-limits.  Right below this, however, was a great quiet swimming spot, which I took advantage of.  Hot day again.\n\nWe stopped at a gelato shop (they're everywhere) and watched people at the main, sandy beach for a while.  Then we went up some pathways above the little town and took some photos. I'd love to make some into jigsaw puzzles.  They are that picturesque. When we came down, I swam again, this time in the main beach.The water is somewhere in the low 70's-very refreshing in the heat.\n\nOur fish picnics were awaiting us at 2PM when we returned to the boat. I actually cheated or\" chickened\" out, you might say, because that's what I ordered.  Can't get that bucket of sardine image out of my mind. Ed ordered the mackerel.  Both had a great wood-smoked flavor from the way they were cooked and were served with some delicious cole slaw         ( and wine, if you wanted it).  There were soft drinks and water, also.\n\nWe started back out to sea while we were eating. Then we stopped for about 50 minutes each at two more islands:  Sipan and  Kolocep. We didn't swim at these, yet they both had nice beaches and little shops.  We walked around the cobbled back streets on both and found some interesting sites--mostly very old churches. A lot of richer families seemed to have their own private chapels.  We headed back around 5 PM.  Saw so many tour boats and even cruise ships.  Beautiful ride. So glad we went on this excursion!\n\nWe ate supper about 6PM back on \"Ed's harbor\" on the upper outdoor patio of the Blindiinja Restaurant--four cheese pizza again-each restaurant's is different, and all good.  While there we watched the moon rise over Mount Srd (ahh..Kate Smith).  We should sleep well tonight!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_952\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0886.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-952\" title=\"DSCN0886\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0886.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Our boat coming to get us[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_953\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0898.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-953\" title=\"DSCN0898\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0898.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Sue riding in the bow[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_954\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0921.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-954\" title=\"DSCN0921\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0921.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Church of St. Mary of Spifica (1483) on Lopud Island[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_955\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0931.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-955\" title=\"DSCN0931\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0931.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> The beach on Lopud Island[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_956\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0941.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-956\" title=\"DSCN0941\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0941.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Sue swimming on Lopud in the crystal clear water[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_957\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0952.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-957\" title=\"DSCN0952\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn0952.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Ed on Lopud.

If you thought road rage, you're too young.  Anyway, we heard this sound a couple of times during our breakfast this morning and it brought back memories.  Weddings here are getting very popular. In fact, several times during the week, I saw brides being photographed around the Old Town. I thought it was odd to see Tuesday or Wednesday weddings, but I think now they were just promotional photos.  But today's were real weddings and they rode through the streets afterwards.  Ed has seen them and said the lead car waves a huge Croatian flag dangerously out the window and everyone waves in celebration.\n\nToday was extremely hot, so we did not climb Mt. Srd as planned.  Possibly tomorrow .Ed had some school work to catch up on, so he went to the office for a while. Our apartment was cool inside, so I stayed in and made sauce. I doctored up a couple of jars we had bought with garlic, onions, parmesan cheese, and Ed's \"mystery meat,\" chivaps.  We had  a nice salad and pasta with the sauce when Ed came in from the office.\n\nLater in the day we packed up to walk around Old Town.  Two goals:  to have coffee and dessert along the Stradum and swim in the moonlight afterwards. So we stopped at a little cafe and Ed had something like a custard with a light caramel sauce and I had something I had wanted to try all last year--\"ice-cream pancake.\"  Just the name sounded like win-win to me.   It\"s a gelato- filled crepe, and it was delicious, but a bit much.  Next time I need a dessert, it'll be just gelato.\n\nWe walked over to Banje Beach afterwards, but it looked like they were setting up for a private party.  The tables on the beach were beautiful with flowers and lights that came from under each table.  Maybe another wedding.  We walked back to the harbor and I swam, where I really wanted to swim in the first place--off the Old Wall.  I pictured the same full moon over Pleasant Lake tonight, but doubted the temperature there would have allowed a swim.  Hearing fireworks now as we're getting ready for bed.\n\n\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_970\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1084.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-970\" title=\"DSCN1084\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1084.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Wedding in Old Town[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_966\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1086.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-966\" title=\"DSCN1086\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1086.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Nighttime at Banje beach[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_967\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1090.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-967\" title=\"DSCN1090\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1090.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Sue swimming in the moon light[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_968\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1092-e1348945723762.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-968\" title=\"DSCN1092\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1092-e1348945723762.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a> Full moon from the old wall[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_969\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1100.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-969\" title=\"DSCN1100\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1100.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Waiting for the catch of the day[/caption]","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":965,"wp:post_date":"2012-09-29 19:49:41","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-09-29 19:49:41","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"saturday-9292012-hot-day-night-swim","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-09-29 19:49:41"},"wp:comment":{"wp:comment_id":138,"wp:comment_author":"Dianna Orvis","wp:comment_author_email":"dorvis4957@yahoo.com","wp:comment_author_url":"","wp:comment_author_IP":"70.188.175.60","wp:comment_date":"2012-09-29 20:24:09","wp:comment_date_gmt":"2012-09-29 20:24:09","wp:comment_content":"I finally got back on the blog.

Srd.  It was 77 degrees when we started out before 9 AM, stopping just for 2 bottles of water at the corner Konzum.  We made it up those 468 steps we had checked out a while ago, the just walked along the road about ¼ mile until we found the path and MORE steps. I don\u2019t know if they don\u2019t want people to go on this hike or what, because nothing tells you you\u2019re headed the right way (except for Ed who had been there).\n\nAside from the steps at the beginning, most of the trial is just a gradual uphill, stony, switchback trail. The beginning is shaded with trees, not unlike what we\u2019re used to in the Adirondacks.  The top portion is pretty open and would have been terribly hot on a sunnier day. There are crosses along the route, numbered for the Stations of the Cross.  We paused and said a prayer at each one. Some have bomb fragments placed at the foot of the cross.  The Croatians are forever grateful for surviving the \u201c91 War and saving the fort at the top.\n\nThe closer we go to the top, the breezier it got, which felt wonderful.  We had fun picking out places we knew as we could see them\u2014our apartment, Ed\u2019s college, last year\u2019s area, etc\u2026  When we reached the top, we headed to the Panorama Restaurant to eat.  We had left without breakfast planning to reward ourselves at the top with a meal.  More than enough of a reward-you can see the photo that follow. As if there wasn\u2019t enough cholesterol in those fries, they actually put a fried egg on their \u201cclub sandwich\u201d!\n\nWe probably should have walked down after that, but took the cable car. I\u2019ve injured a toe and a knee since I\u2019ve been here and downhill steps are the worst on them, so I gave myself a break.  We had a quiet afternoon-I actually napped and Ed listened to old radio shows on line.  A new discovery which I am quite sure I\u2019m losing him to.  A friend (thanks, Therese) sent me an e-mail about a site to get any old radio program\u2014original Superman, The Shadow, Burns and Allen\u2026he may not even notice when I leave on Wednesday.\n\nWe headed to the bar off the Old Wall just before sunset and got great seats to watch the show.  Stayed about 45 minutes.We did get to the Franciscan Church for Mass at 7 PM tonight and then had a little supper at the Kolisem Restaurant at the foot of the Jesuit steps.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_977\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1101.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-977\" title=\"DSCN1101\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1101.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Sue starting out on the trail[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_978\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1112.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-978\" title=\"DSCN1112\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1112.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Ed further up the mountain[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_979\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1122.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-979\" title=\"DSCN1122\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1122.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Distant islands[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_980\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1129.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-980\" title=\"DSCN1129\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1129.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Lunch on top of the world[/caption]\n\n<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1142-e1349037875206.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-981\" title=\"DSCN1142\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1142-e1349037875206.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a><a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1143.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-982\" title=\"DSCN1143\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1143.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a><a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1147-e1349038032623.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-983\" title=\"DSCN1147\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1147-e1349038032623.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><\/a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_975\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1163.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-975\" title=\"DSCN1163\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1163.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> A person crazier than us[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_976\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1169.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-976\" title=\"DSCN1169\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dscn1169.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Dinner near the Jesuit Steps[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":974,"wp:post_date":"2012-09-30 20:52:43","wp:post_date_gmt":"2012-09-30 20:52:43","wp:comment_status":"open","wp:ping_status":"open","wp:post_name":"sunday-9302012-conquering-mt-srd","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":0,"wp:menu_order":0,"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":"","wp:is_sticky":0,"category":{"domain":"category","nicename":"uncategorized","content":"Uncategorized"},"wp:postmeta":{"wp:meta_key":"_elasticsearch_indexed_on","wp:meta_value":"2012-09-30 20:52:43"},"wp:comment":[{"wp:comment_id":139,"wp:comment_author":"John Walsh","wp:comment_author_email":"jwalshnow@yahoo.com","wp:comment_author_url":"","wp:comment_author_IP":"67.241.63.246","wp:comment_date":"2012-10-01 07:37:01","wp:comment_date_gmt":"2012-10-01 07:37:01","wp:comment_content":"I don't know who is enjoying this blog the most..you guys..or us reading it??...(Probably you but..I am really enjoying seeing the various experiences you guys are having each day over there...the trips, the meals, swimming and more and especially the beautiful scenery!

We brought  ice waters with us, but couldn\u2019t resist the fruity drink at a little stop (Salvatores) along the way. We met a couple from Australia who took the picture of us.\n\nIt is so interesting to see the places with which we\u2019ve become familiar from above them. Many have beautiful gardens out back or on their roofs. One even had a little grassy lawn and was out mowing! Must be the only lawn mower in all of Dubrovnik. From the sea of orange tile roofs you would not think there was any green at all, but people make the most of their \u201clittle piece of heaven\u201d and have plants everywhere they can.\n\nWe were back at the apartment before noon.  Ed got ready to head to work for 1PM office hours and I got us caught up on laundry. Later in the afternoon I walked up to the beach behind his building, which had quite a few people for the quiet place it is.  I entered  the water from a new direction and discovered a cave! I was so excited (but held it in again).  I swam a little ways into it, at least until I was all under rock.  Very cool\u2014just wish I had a picture of it.\n\nWe did get some great photos tonight of the sunset out on the Lapad peninsula. Our plan for the evening was to grocery shop, which we eventually did, but I couldn\u2019t bear to spend sunset time in a store. So when Ed got home at 5, we headed to Lapad to the Hotel More beach café. We just ordered drinks because apparently you can\u2019t get food outside at that time. It was such a perfect place to watch the sunset. Then we roamed inside their bar, which is a cave! So interesting. Around one table you can look down and see water. The ceiling is all lit up like little stars. Ed is definitely going back there with friends sometime. We ended up eating along the Promenade at Konavoka-always a great meal.\n\nWe grocery shopped at the Tommy and then took the bus home.  We each had a backpack full, plus carried two bags each. We figured Ed better load up on the heavy items while there are still two of us to carry things.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_987\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a

If you want to take a little virtual vacation with us, pretend you're staying at one of these places: The Rixos Liberatus Hotel in Dubrovnik, The Radisson BLU Resort, right outside Dubrovnik, or the Hotel Villas on the island we visited the other day, Kolocep, Croatia. Google them--very nice!\n\nMy last full day. In spite of impending rain, I talked Ed into going swimming one more time and we checked out the cave. Water was choppy, but not too hard for a swim. We also had time to to stop on his way to work at the Sesame cafe for coffee.\n\nI'm packing up today. What was I thinking when I went shopping? You either have to come with lots of empty suitcase space or not buy anything. I keep telling myself that I'll be glad at Christmastime that I have all of this, but today, I'm not so sure.\n\nFor our last night here I want to walk the Stradun. It's interesting to \"people-watch\" there. Ed was pointing out that the couples never seem to match. The woman is always wearing something very dressy, and the guy is totally casual. Now this may not make sense to him, but it makes perfect sense to me. It's my theory that women come on these trips always hoping to get to something really high class or formal. So she carefully packs some of her best clothes. The guy just packs some easy travel clothes, and leaves room (smart) for the European beers he'd like to bring home. Now, when it gets late in the trip and they haven't gone anywhere too fancy, the woman pulls out her \"outfit\" anyway, and she's wearing it, wherever. The guy notices and asks if this means he has to get dressed up,too. She tells him that he can just wear what he wants and he does--some old shorts and T-shirt she can't believe he even packed to go to Europe. And there they are, night after night, walking the Stradun.\n\nI'm really going to miss it here. I had unbelievably good weather to enjoy everything. In a sign of the times this AM, the little store near our entryway had switched their display of colorful sun hats to one item--a rain poncho. Time for Rochester...\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1004\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1283.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1004\" title=\"DSCN1283\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1283.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><\/a> Dance beach.

We had a nice conversation over a glass of wine. It was interesting to talk to someone who was born here but went to the US when she was 11, and now lives back here part time. She and her husband are travel agents back in California. She is staying for another week or so.\n\nThis was a sad day. Sue left this morning. 8-( We have had a great time while she was here, as you have seen from her blog entries. I will miss her greatly. As of this writing she has left Dublin and is headed to JFK - the worst airport in the world. From JFK she will fly Jetblue to Rochester where Zac, my son-in-law, or Victor, my neighbor, will pick her up at about midnight. It is comforting to know that so many people are willing to help out. Be nice to Sue, she will be going through Dubrovnik withdrawal, which can be severe at times. This is a hard place to leave.\n\nIt is also a sad day because now I am writing the blog again and you will have to read my writing 8-)\n\nAfter breakfast, we walked for a last trip to the garbage station, always a smelly event, then got one last gelato and a stop to watch the sea. Her Stracciatella (chocolate chip) had extra chocolate. She was happy.\n\nMarco, our driver, picked us up about 11:00 as arranged and we got to the airport at about 11:30 for her 12:30 flight. The Dubrovnik airport is actually in Cilipi. It is smaller than the Rochester airport and is easy to use, like the Rochester airport. It had a moment of disaster in 1996 when  U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the Clinton administration, Ron Brown, was killed in a plane crash in 1996, shortly after the homeland war ended. He was on a trade mission. There is a Wikipedia article about it <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Croatia_USAF_CT-43_crash\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>. The airport was not fully functional at the time and that combined with errors caused the crash. Today it is a bustling modern airport that sees over a million people per year arrive for a stay in Dubrovnik.\n\nOn the way to the airport, Marco wanted to show me the remains of an old Yugoslav military installation that was a resort for top brass, when Yugoslavia existed. It was bombed heavily during the war and has never been repaired. The ride in through the palm trees on the disheveled and ravaged grounds gave you a glimpse of its former glory. The buildings were beautifully constructed but now bombed and riddled with bullets. There is also a beautiful beach. Marco stopped at one building with a caved in roof from a bomb and debris cascading down an elaborate main staircase. It must have been beautiful. Marco pointed out that the entire old city of Dubrovnik looked like this at the end of the war. Dubrovnik certainly has done an unbelievable job of restoration.\n\nThere is a plan to refurbish this site also to accommodate more tourists.  This and the Belvedere Hotel, another unrestored hotel on a beautiful site, would make a good investment. There is interest by a local investor. There is an article <a href=\"http://www.dubrovacki.hr/clanak/43171/kupari-and-belvedere-in-the-sights-of-goran-strok\" target=\"_blank\">here <\/a>but plans have fallen through before. I wrote about the Belvedere in last year's blog (11/16/2011).\n\nAfter taking Sue to the airport, I returned home to get ready for class and office hours. My last class ends at 20:00.\n\nAfter class, my colleague Paul and a professor from RIT who is here for a conference are going to the cave bar that Sue discovered and wrote about at the Hotel More. The bar tender said he knows how to make a Manhattan (Hear that JOHN, a Manhattan!!). I will report on that tomorrow.\n\nHope all is well.

I guess I will have to wait until I am back in Rochester and Jerry can make me one at Mr. Dominic\u2019s at the lake.  The trip was fun, though. Paul, my colleague from ACMT, and I took the bus to the Promenade in Lapad and met Zack from RIT, in town for a conference. On the way we met Doug and his wife Deb and we all went to the cave. This was becoming quite an expedition. Here is a picture of us having a drink. We had a nice time in conversation. As we were leaving at about 23:00 the place was just beginning to fill up. Croatians go out late.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1018\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1296.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1018\" title=\"DSCN1296\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1296.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a> The group in the cave at Hotel More[/caption]\n\nThe reason I decided not to have a Manhattan was that the bar tender really did not know how to make one. I was going to show him, and he was willing, but he seemed uncomfortable because it was not on \u201cthe card\u201d and he also had a limited selection of whiskey.  So no Manhattan is better than a bad Manhattan. I had a Somersby Cider instead and was happy with that. Cider (hard) is a popular drink here, but more so in the UK and Ireland.\n\nI got home about midnight and began following Sue\u2019s trip on the internet. I got up a few times during the night to see how her flights were going. She arrived safely and almost on time. I had an email from her this morning and all was well.\n\nThursday is one of my heaviest workdays and it was a difficult day. There were some technical problems again that I have just not figured out. We have not had these problems at RIT. I feel badly because it frustrates the students. I will try to work on it this weekend. About 13:30 Paul and I decided to walk down to the sandVich shop and get a chivap sandwich for 25 Kuna (about $4). They are big and after eating it I decided that I would probably not need dinner tonight. I was concerned because the shop was closed for the last couple days. It turns out that the lady who works there had been sick and there was no replacement.\n\nWhen I got out of work today at about 18:00 I decided to go to Mass at 19:00. Today is the feast of Sveti Franjo Asiški (Saint Francis of Assisi) and since I have been going to a Franciscan church, I though it was particularly appropriate to go to Mass today. It was not a unique idea. The bells rang as usual about at about 18:40 and when I got there at about 18:50, there was a special ceremony going on in front of the alter dedicated to Sveti Franjo (pronounced Frahn-yoh). The ceremony ended about five minutes before Mass started and seemed to involve men who were novices in the Franciscan order. The church was packed \u2013 standing room only. When Mass started there were eleven priests concelebrating. Although my Croatian is weak, I think they said that the principle celebrant was the Provincial. Here is a picture taken at the beginning of the homily.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1019\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1299.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1019\" title=\"DSCN1299\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1299.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a> Mass on the feast of St. Francis in the Franciscan Church[/caption]\n\nThe Mass was beautiful. There was a choir in the choir loft accompanied by the organ, which I have not heard played before. It was a very moving ceremony and lifted my spirits after a difficult day. I brought my printout of the Mass in Croatian and I am getting pretty good at the responses.\n\nAfter Mass I left church and went to the candy store that Sue likes, to buy some of the fruity candies I like. I have been living with a woman who was a bad influence on me who will go unnamed (Sue) and she got me into candy and gelato. They were out of the fruit chews so I bought four chocolate covered cheries for 5 Kuna. I haven't eaten them yet, but I will have to stop going to that store.\n\nOn my way back, I stopped for gelato at our favorite store. I was recognized as ACMT and the gelato was free. It is nice of them to do it. When I came out I ran into one of my students and had a long conversation with him. He is one of my favorite students and a joy to have in class. I think he will be very successful. We talked about a lot of different things and I asked if he would like a coffee or a beer, but he had to check on his grandmother. His mother is out of town and he was worried about his grandmother.\n\nI have no classes tomorrow. I have some meetings but I do not have to be there early. This is a long weekend here. Croatian Independence Day is Monday 10/8/2012. Holidays are celebrated on the day they occur and most have the day off. However, the following Saturday becomes the workday. I didn\u2019t realize this about Monday because last year it fell on a Saturday, so it did not interrupt the class schedule. The students reminded me in class today. The same will be true on All Saints day, November 1.\n\nI just got off Skype with Sue. It was good the hear her voice. She survived the trip home, but is now tired.\n\nWell, that is all for now.

{"title":"Friday \u2013 10/5/2012 \u2013 Busy but quiet day, two types of thrones, and The Adventures of Superman","link":"http://travelsofed.wordpress.com/2012/10/05/friday-1052012-busy-but-quiet-day-two-types-of-thrones-and-the-adventures-of-superman/","pubDate":"Fri, 05 Oct 2012 19:41:44 +0000","dc:creator":"epholden","guid":{"isPermaLink":false,"content":"http://travelsofed.wordpress.com/?p=1025"},"description":"","content:encoded":"Last night I had planned to go to bed early, but for some reason, when I am alone, I get carried away doing things and the next thing I know it\u2019s midnight. I have been obsessed with old radio shows for quite a while now (The Shadow, Johnny Dollar, Superman, \u2026). WRVO, the Oswego NPR station, has them at 9:00PM every night. They are also on Sirius radio, which we have in our van. I love listening to them.\n\nWhile Sue was here, her friend Therese sent her a web site that has old time radio shows. That kept me up until midnight listening to The Adventures of Superman from the 1930\u2019s. It was fun.\n\nThis morning I did not have to get up early so I slept in until 9:00. When I got up it was 73F and sunny \u2013 an absolutely stunning morning. A light breeze, clear sky, calm sea, what more could you ask? It got up to 77F today.\n\nI spent the morning doing some house cleaning. After Sue left, most of my energies have been spent catching up on school work, so this morning I cleaned up a little, did dishes, took in some laundry from the line and visited the garbage station. It didn\u2019t take long.\n\n<em>Thrones number 1<\/em>: In order to get to the garbage station you have to walk by two sets of public toilets. The one nearest my apartment has been converted to a pay toilet. It costs 2 Kuna to use it \u2013 about 35 cents. No one will use it. The other one, a little farther away, up the hill by my garbage station is free and was constantly busy until a few days ago. That one, however, is now undergoing construction. They have spent several days constructing a barrier around the construction site; something that should have taken a day (Croatian time at play here). So that public toilet is closed. There has been an intensely political argument here about public toilets.  That is because the local populace was so outraged by the charge that the city backed down in putting a charge on the older one close to the garbage station. Now that it is under construction and the people are suspicious that they are going to put a charge on it. We shall see. I had forgotten how amusing small town politics can be. We had similar issues when I was growing up in Fulton, NY. It beats talking about the issues we have to confront in the larger cities.\n\nThe issue now for me, however, is that it is hard and dangerous to get to the garbage station. You have to cross a busy street where there is no cross walk, on a blind curve, and then cross again with no cross walk, then repeat the process in reverse to get back. We shall see how long this lasts. Maybe I should use another garbage station that is a little farther away.\n\n<em>Thrones number 2<\/em>: The HBO series, <em>Game of Thrones<\/em>, is partly filmed here in Dubrovnik and in surrounding areas. Last year this blog mentioned seeing the filming and talking to the actors. They arrived here again last week. They are storing their trucks and some props in the parking lot not far from my apartment, between the thrones mentioned in the last paragraphs. This picture shows what is there tonight. My apartment is in the background on the right.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1027\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1300.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1027\" title=\"DSCN1300\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1300.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a> Props used in Game of Thrones and the trucks used by the crew[/caption]\n\nAfter the cleanup and my expedition to the garbage station, I went in to the office about noon. I had several meetings. Any free time was used to do school work. I left for the long weekend a little after 17:00. I got a lot done today, but there will be more work tomorrow as I plan the next couple weeks of classes and exams.\n\nI made a nice dinner for the first time in a long time. When Sue was here we often went out or Sue would have dinner ready when I got home. That was nice. Tonight, I cooked some boiled potatoes, carrots and chivaps with peppers and onions. It was good. After dinner, I went to Mass then went for a stroll on the Stradun. It was a beautiful evening. There was a beautiful sunset as I left for Mass. The picture below shows the view of the sky between the attached fort (left) and the detached fort (upper right).\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1026\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1303.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1026\" title=\"DSCN1303\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1303.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a> Beautiful sky between the forts[/caption]\n\nSorry for the miscellaneous musings here, but that is all for now. I have to go listen to Superman.\n\nHope all is well.

{"title":"Saturday - 10/6/2012 - Beautiful day to catch up, nice evening","link":"http://travelsofed.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/saturday-1062012-beautiful-day-to-catch-up-nice-evening/","pubDate":"Sat, 06 Oct 2012 20:57:06 +0000","dc:creator":"epholden","guid":{"isPermaLink":false,"content":"http://travelsofed.wordpress.com/?p=1032"},"description":"","content:encoded":"The weather is so monotonous here - sunny and warm - just like Rochester 8-). It was a beautiful day today. It was about 68F when I got up this morning and it got into the high 70s during the day. I really didn't go out much until evening. I spent most of the day working and getting caught up. So it will be a short blog tonight. Not much happened until evening.\n\nWhile I was cleaning up from breakfast, I listened to another old time radio show. I mentioned them yesterday. I have been listening to the <em>Adventures of Superman<\/em>, but I thought I should vary my listening diet so I decided to listen to <em>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar<\/em>. That is a series I enjoy listening to on Sirius radio when I am home and in the van. Each Superman episode runs about 12 minutes. Johnny Dollar, staring Dick Powell, runs about 30 minutes. I listened to the very first episode this morning from December 7, 1948. It was fun to listen to. This was the only episode staring Powell. Three other actors played Dollar from 1949 through 1962.\n\nI also compiled a grocery list so that I can go to the store tomorrow, just the normal things. So it should not take me long when I actually go.\n\nMy friend TJ, who was here with me last year and was frequently referenced in last year's blog, came in for the weekend. He is stationed at ACMT in Zagreb this fall and is enjoying it there also. He is here staying with Paul and will be leaving on Monday. TJ, Paul, Sanja and I went out to dinner tonight at Nishta. Nishta is a vegetarian restaurant. Eddie and I ate there a couple of weeks ago. The food is very good. I had falafel and I enjoyed it. It was served on a bed of lettuce and cucumber on a pita with some hummus and some kind of red sauce that could have been ajar, my new favorite condiment. If you are interested in what falafel is here is a link to Wikipedia. It is like a fritter made of chickpeas.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falafel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falafel<\/a>\n\nHere is a picture of our group having dinner. You can still eat outside here.\n\n<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1306.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1035\" title=\"DSCN1306\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1306.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a>After dinner, we went to a bar called Exit. I had never been there before. It is upstairs on one of the side streets to the left of the Stradun. It was a nice place. We were there fairly early, but we decided to order a beer tower. It contained three liters of beer. That is a lot of beer as you can see from the picture below.\n\n<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1308.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1034\" title=\"DSCN1308\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1308.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a>The four of us worked on the tower for quite a while and we did manage to finish it. I looked around the bar for signs that they could make a Manhattan and I got optimistic so I asked the bartender. He said he could make one but he couldn't figure out how to charge for it because it was not on the price card. Bartenders here seem to be obsessed with that card. So, no Manhattan. At a little after 21:00 I decided that the old man had to go home. So I left the young people to have a good time. It was a very enjoyable evening. It was good to see TJ and good company all around. We will have to go to Mr. Dominic's when we get back to Rochester.\n\nWhen I got home, I called Sue to check in. Kelly answered the phone, which surprised me. Kelly and Justin came in for the weekend, as well as, Laura, Katie and the boys, Sammy and Jack. Cousin Amy also came with Katie to help her with the boys. Sammy said \"Hi Papa\" and went to the globe to see where I was. They had been to the apple farm earlier. They were all getting ready to go to Emily's house for Maggie's birthday. That is one of the things I miss about being over here.\n\nI then called Emily. She also has a house full of company from Zac's side of the family. I thought it best to call before the party started.  Maggie said \"Hi Papa\" and asked how I was. I can't wait to see her when I get home.\n\nWell that is all for now. Hope all is well.

As I mentioned before, I have a tendency to putter around. Last night I had an email from a student who was having a problem with a homework assignment so I decided to answer so he would not be held up. Plus, I read the news and other things.  I went to bed at 00:30. So this morning I slept in until about 9:00. I had planned to get up a little early and go to the 9:30 Mass but I couldn\u2019t make it.\n\nSo I got up and after morning prayer, had breakfast, took yesterday\u2019s laundry off the line, got ready and went to the 11:00 Mass. It was about 72F when I went to Mass and it may get up to 78F. It is cloudy today, however.\n\nWhen I got out to the street, I saw massive crowds and buses. I have not really seen this for a week or so. The tourist season is at an end, but today it seemed to be back in full force. To compound the problem, they must have been filming Game of Thrones in the early morning hours and the set crew was trying to remove lighting, set pieces and hay bales (some not so baled) from the Pile gate area while the tourists were trying to get in. The film crew security was having a difficult time making way for the crew. Similarly, tourists were trying to get out of the church as I was trying to get in. It made a problem of my commute to church and I arrived two minutes late. As I left church, I was filing out of the Pile gate with the tourists and decided I had better go in a different direction today. Out in a play area below the Pile gate, they were feeding the actors and crew. It smelled good. I wonder how I could act as an actor. Hmmmm!\n\nWhen I got to the street, there was the usual traffic jam of tourists, taxis and buses. One taxi was blowing its horn at a motorist who had parked in the taxi zone and it was Marco, my regular driver. The policija were heading toward the woman so she made a quick getaway. They do control traffic well here when the tourist flow is heavy, considering the tight space and volume.\n\nMarco pulled up to wait in line and got out to talk for a minute. He told me that there were five cruise ships in today. That is probably about 15,000 people. This will be a good day to get groceries. My favorite store is in the opposite direction. Marco wanted to know how Sue\u2019s trip was and I said good and almost on time. His response was, \u201cAnd you were worried about her!\u201d\n\nWhen I got home, I answered a couple emails, one had a lengthy reply to a student. He had been working hard on a program and I think my response helped, so he said in a later email.\n\nI then walked down to the Tommy to get some groceries. It was a successful trip. I got another 6 liters of water and some other things I needed. I also got the makings for lentil soup. I am not sure when I am going to make it, but sometime soon. It was a nice day here and I decided to walk home from the store. Here is a picture of what the sea looked like about 14:00.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1040\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1309.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1040\" title=\"DSCN1309\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1309.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a> The beautiful Adriatic sea. Note there are clouds in the sky[/caption]\n\nOn my way home I met a young Korean girl who was looking for a beach, any beach. Now understand, looking for any beach in Dubrovnik is kind of like asking to be shown any leaf on a maple tree. There are beaches everywhere. She mentioned Lapad, but did not want to go that far when I pointed out where it was on the map. So given our location and that she did not care about what the beach was like (sandy, rocky, deep) I decided to take her to Dance beach behind ACMT.  I left her at the corner and pointed and described where to go so I am sure she found it. This was her last day in Dubrovnik. She had been here five days and was going to the Elephite Islands tomorrow then on to Zagreb for a couple days. She asked about beaches on the islands and I told her about the beaches on Lopud, where Sue and I went. After Zagreb she was then going back home to Korea. I told her about the technology museum in Zagreb. It is out of the normal tourist area so she may not find it. We had a nice conversation. After we parted, I went home to put groceries away.\n\nI then did some more school work preparing for next week. While I was working on school work, I listened to a couple of episodes of <em>The Shadow<\/em> from 1930 and a <em>Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar<\/em> from 1949. I love the old time radio web site.\n\nTonight was a beautiful night. The temperature is pleasant. As I mentioned yesterday, my friend TJ is in town for the weekend. He is leaving tomorrow at about 5:00 AM. Marco is picking him up. Tonight we had dinner at Domino Steak House, one of my favorite places. We met at 20:00 at Domino. We were joined by Marco, the driver I have mentioned and talked to this morning and his girlfriend, Danielle. Danielle is a tour guide. We had a very nice time. After dinner we went to a bar called Skybar and had a beer. We had planned to go to the Irish pub, Graff, but it was too crowded. We were joined by a colleague, Kevin, from ACMT and Paul and Sanja. We had a nice time.Kevin and I left about 23:00. Kevin lives near the top of the hill above ACMT so we walked out together.\n\nWhen I left my apartment for dinner, I saw Marco\u2019s car parked in a taxi zone across the street so I knew he was going to get there ahead of me.  Here is a picture of his car.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1041\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1310.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1041\" title=\"DSCN1310\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1310.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a> Marco's car[/caption]\n\nIt is a Chevy Orlando, a model we do not have in the US. It is a nice car, a little smaller than a Chevy Equinox. His car burns natural gas and it saves him money since he puts so many kilometers on it. It also comes in, more common, diesel and petrol (gas) versions. It is expensive to drive here. A drivers license, renewed every four years, costs about 5,000 Kuna ($833). I guess I won't complain about NYS. There are also similarly high fees for car registration, but it includes insurance.\n\nWhen we had finished dinner, Marco asked if we were ready to leave, and we responded that we needed to get the bill. Marco had already paid the bill, that we were his guests. That was very nice of him, and unexpected. Thank you, Marco. Here is a picture of the group at Domino.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1042\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1312.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1042\" title=\"DSCN1312\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1312.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a> Friends TJ, Marco and Danielle with me at Domino[/caption]\n\nThat is all for now. It is 00:05 and I am going to get ready for bed. I have to start getting to bed earlier. Fortunately tomorrow is a holiday (Croatian Independence Day).  Hope all is well.

Yesterday when I was getting groceries I accidentally bought Chocolate Crunchy Pillows instead of Vanilla. It is just not the same. So for the rest of the week, I will have to eat chocolate for breakfast. It is just not right. Those of you who have followed this blog for a long time know about my love affair with Crunchy Pillows, but it is only the vanilla that I like. The company that makes them is Dr. Oetker and they are called Vitalis Crunchy Pillows. As far as I know they are not available in the US. Oh well, I will have to persevere.\n\nWhat a beautiful day today was. I was glad to have the day off for Croatian Independence day. It was very windy overnight and this morning but it calmed down as we approached noon. It was 62F when I got up around 9:30 and got into the mid-70s.\n\nI decided I would climb Mt. Srd today and explore a bit to the left (NW) of the Napoleonic fort. The right (SE) side is where the cable car, restaurant and Cross are. I have never gone to the left. Last night, while I was mistakenly buying Chocolate Crunchy Pillows, I looked up from the Tommy grocery store parking lot and noticed that there was something that looked like another fort a ways to the left. So I decided to see what it was, if I could get there.\n\nBefore leaving, I got the ingredients together for lentil soup. I bought those yesterday also. I put the lentils on to soak. They don\u2019t have celery here like we do. They consider it animal food, but they do use celery leaves and celery root as a seasoning. They sell it in the produce section. They also sell a soup starter kit with a piece of celery root and leaves, a parsnip, four carrots and a cabbage leaf. So I bought one of those (3.99 Kuna).\n\nIt takes about an hour and a half to climb Srd if you go at a comfortable pace. I have gone both faster and slower. I decided that I would buy a bottle of water on the way. Unfortunately, I forgot that all the stores outside the tourist area would be closed today. Oh well, I can have water at the top.\n\nHere is a picture of the view of the detached fort from the start of the mountain trail. It was a beautiful day.\n\n<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1323.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1050\" title=\"DSCN1323\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1323-e1349728218544.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" /><\/a>On the way up, near the top, they have been building some things that I think are going to be benches, though I am not sure. They had started when Sue and I climbed last week. They are building them out of stone. Here is a picture of one of them. Notice the stone chips at the base. They shape each stone on site.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1051\" title=\"DSCN1328\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1328.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nWhen I got to the top, I went into the restaurant to get some water. I decided to sit down and have a piece of chocolate walnut cake (sorry, Sue) and a large bottle of sparkling mineral water. Every hike should have this at the top.\n\n<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1330.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1052\" title=\"DSCN1330\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1330.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a>While wandering, I found what I was looking for, but it was not a fort. It was more like an old wall. I did, however, see some interesting things. Some farm animals that I knew were there, but had never seen. My friends Elizabeth and Stina had mentioned them last year. Stina had seen and confronted them while out running. There were also ground fortifications and foxholes leading to different places that, I think, must have been used during the Homeland War in 1991. Here are some pictures of what I found.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1053\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1340.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1053\" title=\"DSCN1340\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1340.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a> Farm animals, complete with cow bells.

On the way I found a nice outcropping of flowers that Sue and I like. Every time someone tells me what they are, they say it fast and it does not register. So I have no idea what they are called, but they are everywhere. Another plant that grows everywhere is lavender and it was really fragrant today.\n\n<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1359.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1057\" title=\"DSCN1359\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1359-e1349728942613.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" /><\/a>\n\nWhen I got back into civilization, I noticed that there was a huge traffic jam where the cars are trying to get back into the city. There is a loop road that goes around the city but it can become a single point of failure, as we would say in the IT business. A traffic jam seemed odd since it was a holiday, so I figured something was going on. As I walked further down, I found the cause. People park in these diagonal parking spaces then have to back out into traffic. Sometimes people refuse to stop. This is one of those cases. Moral of the story: when driving a Smart Car, don't confront other drivers.\n\n<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1366.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1047\" title=\"DSCN1366\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1366.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a>\n\nI couldn\u2019t figure out why they just didn\u2019t move the cars to get them out of the way and get traffic moving, and several people walked down to tell the girl in the yellow Smart Car to do just that, but she was not budging, until the policija arrived. The officer had a nice BMW motorcycle.\n\n<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1368.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1048\" title=\"DSCN1368\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1368.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a>\n\nWell, that was enough excitement for the afternoon, so I continued home to make my soup. As I arrived, Luci, my landlady, was sweeping up the grape leaves that fell in the wind last night. I mentioned that I was making soup and she gave me some nice bacon to flavor the soup. She had a lot that she had just bought. She also gave me some nice red sweet onions for a salad and some dried figs. When the soup was finished, I brought her a large bowl. I kilo of lentils makes a lot of soup. It came out pretty good, if I do say so myself. I also made some croutons to put on top. While the soup was cooking I took the garbage out and here is the view of the wall and one of the towers of the old city.\n\n<a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1370.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1049\" title=\"DSCN1370\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1370.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><\/a>\n\nNow I have some studies to prepare for class this week.\n\nWell, that is all for now. Hope all is well.

It is bougainvillea. I think she may have actually told me this before but I am going to try harder to remember it this time \u2013 bougainvillea. When Sue reads this I am going to ask her to remember it also \u2013 bougainvillea.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is a beautiful flower and seems to grow everywhere and it climbs whatever it is near. There are several varieties of this plant around the world, but the purple ones are prevalent here. If you are interested in this plant there is a Wikipedia article<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bougainvillea\"> here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We have had more mosquitoes this year than I remember from last year. The mosquitoes here are smaller and darker than in upstate NY. When I first moved in, in August, my landlord mentioned that they had been bad this year and showed me these electric devices that kill mosquitoes, but he hoped that they were mostly gone. These devices look like the electric air fresheners we have at home, about the size of a nightlight. So far I have not had to use them, but the mosquitoes are still out here.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">They are small enough that when you swat at them, the breeze from your hand blows them out of the way. There are one or two mosquitoes in the apartment now and I hope they don\u2019t find me.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Not much happened today. After breakfast I did some laundry and hung it out to dry. While that was in the washer, I did some grading and class preparation. My landlady stopped in to return the dish in which I had given her the soup yesterday. She said it was very good. It was a quiet morning. It was cool today, but sunny and breezy. In general, a nice day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I went into school about 13:00 for office hours and Paul invited me to join him and his guests for dinner. His mother and a friend of hers arrived today from the US for a two week visit. After office hours I had class at 16:00. I gave an exam today. After the exam finished at 18:00, I went home to get ready for dinner. During class it started to rain so there was a light drizzle throughout the evening.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Before dinner, I wandered around the old harbor. There was a cart with a fish that someone had caught today. It looked like a tuna and was about five feet long. When I got to the end of the jetty, there was a beautiful cruise ship anchored just outside the harbor. It is a sailing ship and I think it may be the same one Sue saw when she was swimming one day. Here is a picture. Notice that they are just getting ready to lower the tender on the left side to bring people ashore. The tender arrived while we were eating.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1374.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1064\" title=\"DSCN1374\" src=\"http://travelsofed.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dscn1374-e1349815851659.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" /><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dinner was at the same restaurant where Sue and I had \u201csmall fish fried\u201d a while back. I wasn\u2019t sure about it, but that restaurant has been recommended. So I joined Paul, Sanja, his mother and friend for dinner and it was an enjoyable evening. Both the food and conversation were great. I ordered a platter that had octopus salad, salted anchovies, cheese prepared in oil and fish pate. It was very good, so I am glad I tried that restaurant again. Everyone else liked their food also.  We had a good time in spite of the light drizzle. After dinner we headed back toward home, stopping for gelato on the way. Sanja had to catch a bus back to Zagreb, about an eight hour ride.  She teaches at the University of Zagreb.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">They have finished filming the <em>Game of Thrones<\/em> here for this year. The last of the filming was done near a restaurant that Sue and I wanted to try, but didn\u2019t get the time. The restaurant also did not have good reviews. It is across the street from my apartment, down near the water. <a href=\"http://www.dubrovacki.hr/clanak/43586/filming-in-dubrovnik-comes-to-an-end\">Here<\/a> is a link to an article about the final day of filming.You may have seen pictures of this area in my blog before. It is below the detached fort that Eddie and I toured when he was here.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Well, that is about it for today. Hope all is well.

Wednesdays are days when I work at home in the morning, have office hours from 12:00 to 14:00, programming class from 14:00 to 16:00, a break from 16:00 to 18:00 and database class from 18:00 to 20:00. Then I go home. So there is not much interesting to report.\n\nIt was a beautiful day again. Now, at 20:30, it is still 66F. It got up into the 70s today. It was really a nice day. Though I spent most of it inside, it was nice to have the windows open.\n\nTomorrow, another busy day, it is supposed to be partly cloudy and 71F. Then we are to get some rain on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. This concerns me a little because we are going to the island of Korcula on Sunday. We will take a ferry to get there. I am the chaperone for the study abroad students. One thing about the weather here is that the prediction is often wrong. Let\u2019s hope. Going out on the sea on a ferry to an island, in the rain does not sound inviting. We will see what happens.\n\nI came home on my break between classes and had some leftover lentil soup from Monday.  It was good. I have a lot left. Some is still in the refrigerator and I also froze some. I think I will have lentil soup for the rest of my life. It will be good to have when we start getting cooler days.\n\nOne interesting thing that was reported today in the Dubrovnik Times was that the Hotel Imperial Hilton won the award for being the best hotel in Croatia. The hotel is next door to my apartment and is a beautiful place. You can stay there during the tourist season for about $500 per night. Needless to say I have never stayed there, but it is a nice hotel. It is gorgeous on the exterior and interior. I go occasionally to rent a car or for a meeting.  It is a 19<sup>th<\/sup> century hotel that was severely damaged in the Homeland War in 1991. I have seen videos of it burning. It has been restored to its former glory and is now a 5-star hotel.\n\nThere have been pictures of this hotel on my blog before. <a href=\"http://www.dubrovacki.hr/clanak/43718/and-the-oscar-goes-tohilton-imperial-dubrovnik\">Here<\/a> is the article about the award and <a href=\"http://www.hilton.de/ts/en_GB/hotel/content/DBVHIHI/media/pdf/DBVHIHI_Hilton_Imperial_Dubrovnik_hotelhistory02_download.pdf\">here<\/a> is another with the history of the hotel. I hope you will find these interesting. It is interesting to think that when the hotel was built, Dubrovnik was part of Austria.\n\nThat is all for today. I am off to do some grading and then to bed.\n\nHope all is well.
