# Non-Relational Data Management - Taught by Professor Dave Patric at Rochester Institute of Technology

I enrolled in this course during my third semester at RIT from January 2024 to May 2024. In this course we worked with three non-relational data management systems: XML, MongoDB, and Neo4j. Java and javascript were, at times, used when we worked with MongoDB and Neo4j.

## XML

  ### [Project](XMLProject)

  Create a formatted webpage containing information for three theaters and three movies playing in those theaters using XML and HTML.

  - [Part 1](XMLProject/LongTorales1) - Validated using DTD
    
  - [Part 2](XMLProject/LongTorales2) - Validated using XSD
  
  ### [XML Homework 1](<Week 2/XMLPe01>)

  Create a menu without pictures

  ### [XML Homework 2](<Week 2/XMLPe02>)

  Create the same menu with pictures

## MongoDB

  ### [Database](mongodb)

  This is a database completed after performing all of the MongoDB homeworks. It can be added to any local machine and explored.
  
  ### [Project](MongoProject)

  1. [Build a database containing information for three theathers and three movies playing in those theaters using JavaScript.](MongoProject/LongTorales/LongTorales.js)
  2. [Create a pleasing display for the database using JavaScript.](MongoProject/LongTorales/LongToralesDisplay.js)

  ### [MongoDB Homework 6](<Week 5/LongToralesMPe06/2.js>)

  - Add a geographic location field to a database

  ### [MongoDB Homework 7](<Week 6>)

  - Store images in the MongoDB GridFS Database

  ### [MongoDB Homework 8](<Week 7>)

  - Adding usernames and roles to a database
  - Authorizing users to access a database

  ### [MongoDB Homework 9](<Week 8>)

  - [Scenario 1](<Week 8/scenario1.js>)
      Create a database of three students and two courses and the relationships between them as though each course has 20 students or less.
    
  - [Scenario 2](<Week 8/scenario2.js>)
      Create a database of three students and two courses and the relationships between them as though each course has up to 20,000 students.
  
## Neo4j

  ### [Neo4j Homework 1](<Week 9>)

  ### [Neo4j Homework 2](<Week 10/PENeo02>)

  - [Part 1](<Week 10/PENeo02/Part 1>)
      Create a [database](<Week 10/PENeo02/Part 1/LongToralesPENeo02-Part1.dump>) with people, organizations, and committees.
    
  - [Part 2](<Week 10/PENeo02/Part 2>)
      Query that database.

  ### [Neo4j Homework 3](<Week 10/PENeo03>)

  - Create a [database](<Week 10/PENeo03/LongToralesPENeo03.dump>) of people that are friends with each other and/or manage each other.

  ### [Neo4j Homework 4](<Week 11/PENeo04>)

  - Query a [database](<Week 11/PENeo04/PENeo04.dump>) created in class.

  ### [Neo4j Homework 5](<Week 11/PENeo05>)

  1. Create a [database](<Week 11/PENeo05/PENeo05.dump>) by adding CSV data to a previously created [database](<Week 11/PENeo04/PENeo04.dump>)
  2. Query that database.

  ### [Neo4j Homework 6](<Week 12/PENeo06>)

  - Edit the code of a provided Java program to [create a Java program](<Week 12/PENeo06/LongTorales06.java>) that uses regex to enable a user to query a previously created [database](<Week 11/PENeo05/PENeo05.dump>) in a GUI.

  ### [Neo4j Homework 7](<Week 12/PENeo07>)

  - Edit the code of a provided Java program to [create a Java program](<Week 12/PENeo07/LongTorales07.java>) to insert new data into a previously created [database](<Week 11/PENeo05/PENeo05.dump>) using a GUI.

  ### [Neo4j Homework 8](<Week 13/PENeo08>)

  1. Create a [database](<Week 13/PENeo08.dump>) containing three students and two courses and the relationships between them.
  2. Query that database.
