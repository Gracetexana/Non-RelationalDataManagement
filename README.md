# Non-Relational Data Management - Taught by Professor Dave Patric at Rochester Institute of Technology

I enrolled in this course during my third semester at RIT from January 2024 to May 2024. In this course we worked with three non-relational data management systems: XML, MongoDB, and Neo4j. Java and javascript were, at times, used when we worked with MongoDB and Neo4j.
