# Non-Relational Data Management - Taught by Professor Dave Patric at Rochester Institute of Technology

I enrolled in this course during my third semester at RIT from January 2024 to May 2024. In this course we worked with three non-relational data management systems: XML, MongoDB, and Neo4j. Java and javascript were, at times, used when we worked with MongoDB and Neo4j.

## XML

  ### [Project](XMLProject)

  Create a formatted webpage containing information for three theaters and three movies playing in those theaters using XML and HTML.

  - [Part 1](XMLProject/LongTorales1) - Validated using DTD
    
  - [Part 2](XMLProject/LongTorales2) - Validated using XSD
  
  ### [XML Homework 1](<Week 2/XMLPe01>)

  Create a menu without pictures

  ### [XML Homework 2](<Week 2/XMLPe02>)

  Create the same menu with pictures

## MongoDB

  ### [Database](mongodb)

  This is a database completed after performing all of the MongoDB homeworks. It can be added to any local machine and explored.
  
  ### [Project](MongoProject)

  1. [Build a database containing information for three theathers and three movies playing in those theaters using JavaScript.](MongoProject/LongTorales/LongTorales.js)
  2. [Create a pleasing display for the database using JavaScript.](MongoProject/LongTorales/LongToralesDisplay.js)
